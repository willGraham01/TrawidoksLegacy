# Snare Trap

A trap formed from a chord of rope or wire, with one end tied loosely into a loop.
The non-looped end of the snare is typically secured to the ground or another heavy object, on some occasions creating a hook trigger.

When a creature places its foot inside the trap and attempts to pull away, the loop tightens as the chord is stretched.
If the hook trigger comes loose, the loop closes and tightens rapidly around the object or body part that got caught in it, and if positioned correctly can use a pulley-motion to hoist the trapped object / creature off the ground.

## Setting up the Snare

When setting up a snare, a creature needs at least 5ft of hempen rope, 1ft of which is used to form the loop.
A creature must also have a suitable object to use for a hook trigger, such as a tent peg, if it wishes to add a hook trigger to the snare.
It takes 5 minutes for a creature with suitable knowledge to setup a snare.

The loop of the snare is treated as occupying a 5ft square, that other creatures can pass through.
The location of the counterweight / anchor and hook trigger of the snare trap should also be noted for disarming purposes.
A snare trap can be disarmed by carefully untying the loop or removing the anchor / hook trigger.

## Triggering the Snare

When a creature enters a square occupied by the loop of a snare trap, it must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 14) or trigger the snare trap.
Creatures that are not aware of the snare's presence have disadvantage on the saving throw.

On a failed save, the creature is restrained to the square that the loop occupies, until it it frees itself or is freed from the loop.
If the trap was setup with a hook trigger, the creature is suspended upside-down (harmlessly) a few feet from the ground (depending on the length of rope used).

## Escaping the Snare

Cutting the chord between the loop and the anchor or hook trigger frees a trapped creature from the snare.

A trapped creature can use an action to make a Sleight of Hand check (DC 12) to escape the trap, provided it has a means of either cutting the chord or manipulating the tightened knot around its caught body part.
Creatures that do not have opposable thumbs, or that are suspended upside down, have disadvantage on this check.
