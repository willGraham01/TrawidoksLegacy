The wolves native to Trawidok's woods are vicious, just like any other.
Wolves are rarely encountered alone, and typically roam in hunting parties at least 3 wolves strong.

## Traits

*Keen Hearing and Smell.* The wolf has advantage on Perception checks that rely on hearing or smell.

*Pack Tactics.* The wolf has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the wolf's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

## Actions

**Bite**: *Melee weapon attack*, +4 to hit, reach 5ft., 1 target. Hit; 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage. On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 11 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
