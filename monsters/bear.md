The bears that roam Trawidok's woods stick together in tight-knit groups, affording them protection against the other denizens of the woods and also facilitating their survival and hunting needs.
These bears are always on the lookout for food, but are not actively hostile towards other creatures that they don't perceive as prey - like wolves or people!
They will root around in anything that is unguarded when seeking food however, and will attack if threatened or provoked.

## Traits

*Keen Hearing and Smell.* The bear has advantage on Perception checks that rely on hearing or smell.

## Actions

The bear makes one attack, either with it's bite or with it's claws.

**Bite**: *Melee weapon attack*, +6 to hit, reach 5ft., 1 target. Hit; 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage. On a hit, the target is grappled by the bear.

**Claws**: *Melee weapon attack*, +6 to hit, reach 5ft., 1 target. Hit; 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage. On a hit, the target must succeed in a contested Athletics check with the bear, or be knocked prone.
