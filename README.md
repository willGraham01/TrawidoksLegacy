# [The Piranhas of Halfyord](https://willgraham01.github.io/PiranhasHalfyord/)

The affluent merchant town of Halfyord has recently fallen on hard times.
A high-ranking wizard who resides in the town has gone missing without a trace.
Their disappearance has suspiciously coincided with the resurgence of the Piranhas - a criminal gang that once held [de facto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto) control of the town.
Now the Piranhas are back, and have strung together a high-profile and highly-successful crime spree, with their gang members seemingly aided by magical forces that the guards cannot hope to match without help.
As the authorities hatch a plan to stop the gang, a group of adventurers finds themselves caught up in the events that are unfolding.
Will they be able to teach the Piranhas that they've bitten off more than they can chew?

The Piranhas of Halfyord was initially intended to be an introductory story that would setup a "Western Marches" setting or campaign.
It is a light-hearted adventure that tries to balance simplicity with enough investigative elements to still be interesting, as well as providing a number of "combat" encounters where the objective of the aggressors isn't necessarily to outright kill the defendants.
There are a few shoe-horned aspects of the story, as at the time I was designing it to fit around various (somewhat artificial) constraints as set by the group I was playing with.

The adventure is designed for a party of level 3 characters, and these should not need to be optimised - aside from the final confrontation, the focus of the adventure is not combat (it is possible for the party to be in initiative order but be under no actual threat of death for most of the "combat" scenarios).
The adventure tries to balance around a party of 4 level 3 characters, though the focus of the adventure is not intended to be combat.

## Feedback and Contributing

Feedback about the adventure; either your experiences as a DM using the material provided or as a player who has experienced the story, is always welcome.
You can use the [issues tab of the repository](https://github.com/willGraham01/PiranhasHalfyord/issues) to open an issue if you think there is an aspect of the adventure you would like changed or adjusted - though please be constructive and provide ideas for a solution, or at least something that can foster a discussion.

Contributions in the form of fixing typos, additional content for the scenes, sample characters, and the like is all also very welcome.
You will need to fork the [main repository](https://github.com/willGraham01/PiranhasHalfyord) ([click here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) for a guide on how to do this) so that you have an editable copy of the files.
Then, make the changes that you deem necessary, and once you are happy with them [open a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) against the main repository, and tag the repository owner for review.
To speed things up, you'll want to include a bit of information about the changes that your pull request introduces, and whether it is directly linked to any of the issues that are currently open.
Someone will then take a look at your changes, possibly give you some comments to address, and then merge your pull request into the main repository.

## Format of the Repository

The repository consists of several [markdown files (`.md`)](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) that are rendered into a website [using `Jekyll`](https://jekyllrb.com/).
The website build is taken care of by GitHub actions, and the site is automatically updated whenever changes are introduced to the `main` branch.

To add or remove content, simply edit the corresponding markdown files, or create new ones.
As a general rule, try not to add images to the repository unless absolutely necessary (since `git` has a hard time tracking changes to these files, which can bloat the repository).
Likewise, avoid adding `.pdf` or other non-plaintext files where possible.
