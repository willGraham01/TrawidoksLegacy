## Backstory

Zanke is the only child of Ginter and TSTK-mother's-name Dijkstra.
Village life leaves little room for comforts, and Zanke was pitching into the village community along with the other children from an age as young as 4.
She enjoyed listening to her parents and friends' parents recount the legends surrounding Trawidok's founding, and would often say that she was going to "find her own horse friend and go on adventures" in the typical way that children talk about their aspirations.

Her mother died of sickness when she was around 8, which shifted the dynamic between Zanke and her father.
Her father had insisted that TSTK-mother's-name remain in the village to be treated, stating that it was too dangerous for her to make the trip to a larger city, and that there would be nothing that could be done in the cities that couldn't be done with what was available in Trawidok.
The young Zanke overheard her father having such disagreements with some of the other members of the village, but was too young to voice a coherent argument.
Whilst her mother's death only served to fuel her father's belief that Trawidok was suffering the consequences for abandoning its traditional ways; Zanke's disagreement of her father's decision not to seek outside treatment would evolve into her viewpoint of respecting tradition, but not being bound by it.

Upon the death of her mother, Zanke was left to be raised by her father and his close friends from Trawidok's traditionalist faction.
Her education thus mostly concerned the running of the family farm, and recounting of Trawidok's oral history.
She was increasingly forbidden from any activities involving the racecourse, and slowly watched as her friends fell into two groups - those who sought work at the racecourse for their own social mobility, and those who had been entrenched with their elder's traditionalist views.
Zanke also watched her father slowly develop a bitter hatred for the racecourse, the growth of which only hastened when Caius the Younger took charge.

Zanke would fortuitously be running an errand in Halfyord when her father and his close allies launched their breakout attempt for the horses at the racecourse, which when coupled with the factionalism in the village, was enough to absolve her of any guilt or involvement.
Ginter had actually purposefully kept Zanke in the dark about the plan, and sent her on this trip to account for this exact reason.
Upon her return to Trawidok and being informed of the situation, the matter was largely out of her hands.
Visiting her father in his holding cell, Ginter expressed his wish for Zanke to not abandon the family's farm, expressing regret for his actions but insisting they were necessary.
Zanke was in attendance at her father's trial - her first real interaction with Caius the Younger - but did not attend her father's execution once his trial was over.

## Appearance & Personality

Zanke wears practical farm clothes that sport a number of patches and scuff marks.
Both her shirt and trousers are a shade of brown, and her boots are a very beaten black colour.
She wears a tool belt at all times, and carries a sickle as both a farming tool and a weapon if she needs it in self-defence.
Around her neck is the sole piece of jewellery that her family owns, a simple gold chain necklace with a horse head pendant, that has been handed down the family for generations.

Zanke stands around 5"7', and very rarely is seen slouching or hunching her shoulders.
Life in a farming village has given her a build that in the city would be described as skinny, but in actuality is more athletic than her appearance and clothing would suggest.
She has ginger hair, blue eyes, and a face splashed with freckles across her nose, cheeks, and lower forehead.
Her face has not quite lost its childish roundness, but her features bear striking similarity to her late father.

Demeanour, personality, character quirks.
Zanke has a very direct and down-to-earth approach to conversation and other people.
This attitude is largely indifferent to the other person's social status or relation to her, besides close friends and family members.
She is very hard-working, even when she does not necessarily want to be doing the job she has been given, and is very respectful of this trait in others.

Although Zanke is not as stubborn as her father was with regards to maintaining the village traditions, her upbringing around her parents' friends who shared similar views has shaped her values.
She has a innate respect for tradition and following the tried and tested ways that have been passed down by elders, but at the same time does not fear change - the inability to do so being what she thinks ultimately lead her father to his death.
She is not afraid to challenge tradition or authority - a trait inherited from her father - and one that might well drag her into the same conflicts as her parent.

In the present day, Zanke is in a rather unique position of being between the two factions that have developed among the villagers, and has become something of a mediator.
The traditionalists listen to her due to the understandings and teachings of her father, whilst the younger generation working in the stables are some of her childhood friends and know she is not outwardly opposed to their employment or social prospects.
Undergoing the rite of passage a year ago also won her a lot of respect from the traditionalist faction, though Zanke predominantly undertook it due to the need for more man (horse-?) power on the farm and her lingering childhood desire.

## Relations

- Ginter Dijsktra: Zanke is Ginter's sole child, and was around 16 when her father was tried and executed for his actions at the racecourse. Her relationship with her father when he was alive was largely positive, though the extremities of his views did not pass down to her. Upon his death, she chose to remain in Trawidok and take over the running of the family's farm, as per his wishes.
- Pakana: Zanke's horse, whom she bonded with during her rite of passage. Zanke treats Pakane well, and uses him as a workhorse on the farm as well as a travelling horse when she does need to travel to Halfyord or other nearby settlements. She is unaware that Pakane's presence allows the woodland spirit's influence to reach Trawidok.
- Trohet: Fond memories of working with her late father's horse are one of the reasons why Zanke chose to undergo the rite of passage herself. Zanke has not seen Trohet since her father's death, since her father released Trohet before his arrest to prevent Trohet being confiscated by the Baron-Sir as compensation.
- Baron Caius Equirrion: Zanke is too young to remember the racecourse opening, but has childhood memories of some of the races that were held in the late baron's twilight years. Though as a child she enjoyed the races, she would not understand why her father disapproved of them until her late teens.
- Baron Sir Caius Equirrion the Younger: Though she does now know the Baron-Sir personally, there is a natural resentment for the man who was essentially responsible for the severity of her father's punishment. Though she doesn't believe her father deserved to let off free, she blames the Baron-Sir for pushing for her father's execution. Over the past 4 years, she has come to view the racecourse as detrimental to Trawidok, due to the Baron-Sir's change in management policies compared to his father.
