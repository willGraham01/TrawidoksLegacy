## Backstory

Paige's backstory beyond the recent events in Trawidok is entirely customisable.
They are not a major character in the events of the story, primarily serving the role of the "quest giver".

FIXME either include recent events, or redirect to the right part of the story.

## Appearance & Personality

Paige wears travelling clothes; practical road leathers with an overcoat, hiking boots that border on military-grade, and a beret-like cap with a feather through it.
A satchel bag is almost always slung over their shoulder, and packed to the brim with letters and small parcels.
They carry a small broach with an insignia that identifies them as a courier, and often carry notes or seals from important customers to show to recipients upon delivery (to verify the sender is who they claim to be)!

As a gnome, Paige stands around 3"2' and has a remarkably good posture, especially considering the amount of time they spend on the move on wagons and mounts.
They're not young by gnomish standards, but their lifestyle is keeping most signs of age at bay.
Their build is lean, and their cheeks are and nose are tinted red due to the near constant exposure to the elements whilst on the move.
Paige's long hair is often tied up to keep it out of their eyes when travelling.

Like most gnomes, Paige is very approachable and friendly, and generally excited to be meeting new people and going to new places.
They're not quick to take offence, but will deal out what they're dealt if jokes are made at their expense.
They find it hard to sit still for elongated periods of time, and at times sound overly enthusiastic about the topic of conversation.

## Relations

- Caius the Younger: Paige loaned a horse from the racecourse stables when passing though Trawidok. The Baron-Sir gave her a copy of his [bounty letter](FIXME) to pass on to the governor of Halfyord, and dispatched a couple of guards with the caravan.
- Rolf Timberfell: Was one of the guards sent along with the caravan after it left Trawidok. There wasn't much time for chatting along the way, but Paige does acknowledge the guards were very helpful during the ambush in the night. This was somewhat soured by their departure back to Trawidok the following day.

## Plot Relevant Knowledge

- Paige has a copy of the Baron-Sir's bounty letter, so knows surface-level information about the situation in Trawidok.
  - They knows that horses have gone missing.
  - They believe this is the reason why the Baron-Sir gave her caravan guards for the journey, after she loaned the horse. It's also why they think he was reluctant to do so in the first place.
  - If asked whether they will need to pay for the horse, Paige will state that the Baron-Sir will likely forward the expense claim to Paige's company, rather than them personally. This is standard procedure, so Paige is not worried about possible repercussions.
