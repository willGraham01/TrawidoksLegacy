## Backstory

## Appearance & Personality

Paige wears travelling clothes; practical road leathers with an overcoat, hiking boots that border on military-grade, and a beret-like cap with a feather through it.
A satchel bag is almost always slung over their shoulder, and packed to the brim with letters and small parcels.
They carry a small broach with an insignia that identifies them as a courier, and often carry notes or seals from important customers to show to recipients upon delivery (to verify the sender is who they claim to be)!

As a gnome, Paige stands around 3"2' and has a remarkably good posture, especially considering the amount of time they spend on the move on wagons and mounts.
They're not young by gnomish standards, but their lifestyle is keeping most signs of age at bay.
Their build is lean, and their cheeks are and nose are tinted red due to the near constant exposure to the elements whilst on the move.
Paige's long hair is often tied up to keep it out of their eyes when travelling.

Like most gnomes, Paige is very approachable and friendly, and generally excited to be meeting new people and going to new places.
They're not quick to take offence, but will deal out what they're dealt
