## Backstory

FIXME

## Appearance & Personality

Rolf is normally to be seen in his armoured getup; scaled armour that sits between light leather and full plate to offer modest protection without sacrificing travel comfort, with a large battleaxe across this back and a travel pack around his waist.
When out on a bounty mission, he typically carries manacles and similar restraints around his belt, for apprehending suspects that are wanted alive.
He wears little jewellery or otherwise outward signs of wealth, though his armour and weapons are well-kept and of a high quality.

Rolf stands 5" tall on the dot, and has a stocky build that is typical of most dwarves.
He has short, brown hair that transitions into sideburns and then a bushy beard.
The has thick eyebrows, the right of which is broken by a scar that runs from his forehead onto his cheek.

Rolf is rather good-humoured for a mercenary, and is a popular and capable enough leader that he has assembled a small team that he operates with on bounties.
However, he is deeply protective of his bounties - encounters with groups competing for the same quarry as him often result in threats, sabotage, or violence.
Morals, similarly, are often cast aside when conducting mercenary work - Rolf has long since taken the view that the pay-cheque at the end of the day, and possible repeat business, are what matters in his line of work.

Rolf does not come from particularly high society, and views himself as self-made.
He respects strong work ethics and the ability to knuckle under when things get tough, such respect is also something he extends to his targets to ensure he does not underestimate them.
Though he does not respect wealth directly, he does have a loyalty towards repeat employers - mostly because this ensures him a reliable stream of income.
To this end, his personal morals are usually aligned with those of his employers; at the end of the day, the job he's being paid for needs to be done.

## Relations

- Caius the Younger: Rolf and his group have been employees of Caius for at least 5 years by the time of the adventure. In light of recent events, Rolf is being very well-paid by the Baron-Sir to solve his horse-rustling problem, though relations took a hit when the horse sent with Paige escaped under his guard.
