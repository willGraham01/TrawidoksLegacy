## Backstory

Caius the Younger, or "Baron Sir Caius Equirrion the Younger, 2nd Baron Equirrion" to give him his full name (as he so often insists on being addressed by) is the son of the late Baron Caius.
Born into a minor noble household, Caius was afforded an education and lifestyle that many could only be envious of.
Being only minor nobility however, he often found himself the end of jokes with the other noble children, who tended to mock him for his family's relatively low status in the higher social circles.
This treatment would eventually grow into a drive to further his family's social standing, both for his own personal satisfaction and to humble the other families that he deemed to have mocked him in the past.

Since his father's death and his subsequent inheritance, Caius has expanded the racecourse in Trawidok and begun running it much more like a business.
He uses the popularity of the derbies with the upper classes as a way to elevate his own social status and make profit; the nobles are dependent on him to put on the races, and have taken to paying him to rear horses for them which can then compete for their own glory.
Trawidok is now Caius' home, though he spends much of his time in the capital city when he is not required at the racecourse.
He is generally mistrusted by the more traditionalist villagers ever since [FIXME execution incident](), but he deems them beneath his station so tends to pay their resentment no heed, and often use them as a scapegoat or source of derision - the hypocrisy is lost on Caius.

## Appearance & Personality

Caius always dresses in finery, determined to put on a display of wealth whenever he appears in a social situation, or in public.
Clothes with gold or silver trims, a pocket watch, signet ring, and walking cane are all staples of his attire.

Caius stands at about 5"11', with an average build that is starting to show signs of a beer-belly.
He is always clean shaven, and has his short hair is dyed black at the edges to hide the signs of grays that are starting to appear.
His face, much like his gut, is starting to get chubby.
The Equirrion linage also sports a prominent nose and brown eyes, to which Caius is no exception.

Caius' tone and mannerisms greatly depend on his present company.
He is well-mannered amongst noble peers, but also adept at playing politics and engaging in social gossip at upper-class gatherings.
He is commanding, and demanding at times, to anyone else who he deems below his station.
Though this attitude softens towards longer-serving employees, so long as they continue to address him properly and afford him the respect his station deserves from them.
Caius will insist on being introduced by his full title whenever he meets someone new, and will insist on being addressed properly (nothing short of "Baron Sir" will do) by those of lower social station.

Put simply, Caius respects the respect others command, and the status which it brings them.
This respect often gives way to jealously when meeting someone he deems higher up than him, and breeds a desire to outclass the individual(s) in some way.
Conversely, those of lower social status are barely worth his time - the feudal system is a natural representation of societal order in Caius' eyes.
Naturally, Caius' greatest fear is irrelevance, or obscurity.
