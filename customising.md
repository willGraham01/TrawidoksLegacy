The Piranhas of Halfyord is presented in a manner that makes the adventure self-contained, and suitable for a one-shot or an introductory session.
However its setting might not be directly suitable to already-running campaigns that want to use the story as a small side quest or plot point in a grander scheme.
As a general rule, the setting provided in the adventure is also deliberately kept as vague as possible, without leaving unsatisfying "gaps" in the world that players might come across - at least through natural exploration and interaction with the story!
But in this section we will go into more detail, and break down some ideas for customising and adapting the adventure to suite different needs, settings, and purposes.

## Core Components of the Adventure

The fundamental plot of the adventure can be summarised (rather abstractly) in the following bullet points:

- A criminal gang is looking to score some wealth, but lacks the means.
  - The Piranhas fulfil this role.
  - After falling from their high point when Kamonas and Shufharz were appointed, they now want to escape to another city to re-establish themselves.
  - They lack the funds, and the means to obtain them, to achieve this however.
- A public-figure has motive to aid the criminal gang, providing assistance they otherwise would not have.
  - Groubun fulfils this role.
  - His motive is that he (rightfully) believes his career is at a dead end all the while Faire is Ordinator. Plus he hates Faire as a person and as a colleague / supervisor.
  - His assistance is the potions that allow the gang to perform their heists.
- There is some authoritative body that wants the criminal gang dealt with, and has a plan for exposing them.
  - This is Kamonas and Shufharz.
  - Shufharz' plan to deliberately allow the gang to stage a heist and track them to their HQ is the plan for exposure.
- There is some trade-off the party may have to make between apprehending the gang leaders, and apprehending the public figure.
  - This is largely optional, and is represented in the adventure by Groubun's suspicion.
  - Incurring penalties to Groubun's suspicion usually returns valuable information about the Piranhas or their activities, or the deal between Groubun (the public-figure) and the Piranhas gang. In the final confrontation, this disincentives the party from taking Carlton's deal (since he will have little to offer), but allows Groubun to escape if they don't take it.

So long as these components are present, the adventure should otherwise work regardless of other adaptations due to setting constraints.

## Like-For-Like Replacements

Before we get into gritty details about larger aspects of the adventure, it is worth mentioning that most "surface-level" aspects of the adventure are like-for-like interchangeable with a replacement you have on hand.

The characters that the party will meet are the easiest examples; Shufharz does not have to be a half-orc, Groubun a dwarf, etc.
Their names, appearances, and abilities can all be customised to your liking.
Their personalities can also be adapted to suit your needs, though you might need to change their backstories and motivations for the plot to continue to make sense.
Some characters might even be made redundant when you do this, which is not a bad thing, but be sure to check that everyone still has a meaningful role to play.

Hope in particular is worth mentioning here, since she is intended to become the "caretaker" character for a Western-Marches style campaign.
She is set up to take over the Day's Rest Tavern (that the party will begin to use as a base) at the end of the adventure, so you should replace her with your desired caretaker NPC if you have one in mind.
Alternatively, you can have the former owner of the tavern (who is mentioned in some correspondence with Hope) return to take ownership if you can't rework Hope's role to fit with your narrative.

Similarly, the stat-blocks of the enemies and reward provided for the adventure can be easily customised to suit your needs.
"Reward items" can be placed either in Carlton's room, or in Groubun's room at the Ordo Magicae as befits their nature - or given by Kamonas / Shufharz / Jenessa if necessary.
If you want to run a slightly deadlier / tougher adventure, you may want to buff the stat blocks for a basic Piranhas gang member (currently modelled after the _bandit_ stat-block) and Animated Loot (modelled off a _wolf_ stat block), or simply add more of these creatures to the encounters.

Finally, the various factions encountered in the adventure are also highly customisable.
The Ordo Magicae is kept deliberately vague, allowing you to replace it with whatever organisation (magical or otherwise) that fits your world setting.
The Piranhas gang likewise can be re-flavoured in terms of name, appearance, and history.

## Overhauling Halfyord

As presented, the town the adventure takes place in only needs an excuse to possess;

- a public area for the "plant" or "reverse heist" to occur,
- a front for a hideout,
- a public area for the first attack to take place,
- a residence for the "public-figure" who is working with the gang.

How large the town is, its demography, geography, history, as well as what services and amenities are available are otherwise adaptable to suit your needs.
You may choose to restrict what the town has to offer if it provides some additional complication for your players to overcome.

You will need to ensure that where-ever the "reverse heist" is taking place is suitable for the scouting portion of the adventure, or skip out this section entirely (in which case, you might need another excuse to send the party to the hideout "front").
You will also need to adapt the premise of whichever scenes are taking place at the aforementioned locations, so that they make sense - you can't remove the docks but keep the original premise of the reverse heist, for example.

## The Introductory Scene

The public area for the first attack to take place, that kicks off events and gives the party a vested interest in going on the adventure, does not need to be the Great Market Square as described.
Indeed, if the (characters in the) party do not know each other going into the adventure, it might be prudent to engineer a scenario that invests them more heavily in working together, or places them in the same location by more than just coincidence.

You could have the original setting be a high-end store on the main street of the town, for example.
Each party character could be out shopping for or looking to sell a valuable item, or carrying one on their person when the attack is sprung, causing them to loose whatever valuable item they possessed.

You could also have the characters arriving at the docks at the start of the adventure.
Have the docking and unloading / disembarking procedures cause a hold-up which places the party in the vicinity of each other for a while, and have the gang spring their first attack here, again making off with something precious to the party if needs be.

## The Hideout Dungeon Crawl

The final portion of the adventure (when the party enters the gang's hideout) is fully customisable as a dungeon crawl - just make sure that the vault is still included!
Other clues that are present in the hideout as it is presented may also need to be moved to other parts of the adventure (or re-skinned if you are doing more extensive customisation).
But you have the option of expanding or changing the layout of the hideout, the dangers that are encountered inside, and the way the final confrontation with the leaders plays out.

How the party gains entry into the hideout is also customisable, depending on how you've setup your "front".
You could allow for the party to follow the Animated Loot via the sewers, and have the party start the dungeon crawl from the vault, for example.
Alternatively, you might force the party to enter the hideout via an entrance that they need to discover the location of, either by interrogating a gang member or finding a clue in the front itself - there is no reason that the front and the hideout need to be physically connected.

## The Heist Plan

Shufharz' idea to plant some bait and draw out the Piranhas is the intended mechanic for the party to enter the hideout.
There is no reason why it has to take place at the docks - it could be a museum exhibit, escort of a holy relic through the streets, or public speech or unveiling.
In any case, you should ensure that there is the opportunity for the party to scout out the location beforehand, and discover the information that is available in the base adventure (which you may have to re-skin).

However, you may decide to do away with the entire "reverse heist" plan entirely.
You can run a more investigation focused adventure by placing more clues in the Ordo Magicae and Day's Rest Tavern scenes (or whatever you customise them into), and have the party learn of the hideout more naturally, via the fruits of this investigation.
The only thing to ensure the party has before going into the hideout, is some suspicion of a connection between the public figure and the criminal gang.
How they obtain this suspicion, as well as how they gain access to the hideout, is otherwise entirely up to you.

## Example: Groubun the Politician

As an example, let's pretend we are running a world setting where large organisations of magic users do not exist.
This means that the Ordo Magicae needs to be re-thought, as do it's members.
This also has the knock on effect of potentially removing what Groubun actually offers to the Piranhas gang, as well as his own motivations for helping them in the first place (if he can just leave rather than being bound as Faire's apprentice).

We can fix Groubun's motivation by instead making him a rival politician to Kamonas - previously one of the corrupt officials in league with the Piranhas, who cut ties to survive Shufharz' initial efforts at dismantling the gang.
Since Kamonas has taken over, Groubun's personal wealth has declined, and he has been sidelined in favour of more professional and proficient government officials.
How he is resentful, and has discretely gotten in touch with his old contacts in the gang.
He wants them to kick up another crime wave, to attempt to convince the public that Kamonas and Shufharz haven't actually got the situation under control.
When they are replaced for their "ineffective" handling of the situation, Groubun will then swoop in to fill the power vacuum, and the gang can leave the town to give the illusion that Groubun has "fixed" everything.

We do have to explain what Groubun is offering to the Piranhas gang; this could just be the promise to let the gang escape Halfyord once he takes charge (mixed with the sweetness of revenge on Shufharz), or something more sinister and akin to the gang's "golden days".
He might leak security blueprints or plans to the gang if we're looking for more practical benefits that he can offer the gang, which can explain their recent string of successful crimes.

We have also effectively written Faire out of the story - we don't need him any more to explain Groubun's motivations.
We do however need a replacement for the Ordo Magicae and Jenessa; we could re-skin Jenessa as Groubun's secretary or assistant, and have the scene about visiting the Ordo Magicae instead be a visit to Groubun's office - we can make Groubun overseer of public relations, "police commissioner", or something to that effect that means paying him a visit would be worthwhile.
It can also be used to paint some suspicion over him, if the party is told that he is one of the city officials that would have access to security plans.

The other aspects of the adventure largely still make sense.
Though we might want to re-skin The Day's Rest from a tavern to some other kind of business that it makes sense for (our new Groubun) to have a link to.
We can still have Fordem be the person who mans the front, and Hope can still be the unknowing staff member there.
We also might swap out Shufharz' plan to setup a situation in which the gang wants to attack, to her planning security for an upcoming event - maybe a valuable diamond will go on display at the town museum, and she suspects the gang might have designs on acquiring it.
These suspicions will be well-placed, since Groubun will have leaked the museum blueprints to the gang.

There are other teething issues to sort out; most notably we'll need to design some of the clues that are given in the base adventure so that there is still reason to suspect Groubun, and suspect that Fordem's business has a link to the gang's hideout.
But otherwise, we now have a version of the adventure that suits our setting.
