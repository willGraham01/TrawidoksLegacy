## The Legend of Trawidok

The area that would eventually become the site of the village of Trawidok was originally grassy plains and rolling hills.
To the west these plains came to a natural boundary in the river Hal, whilst to the north, east, and south the hills and open plains eventually gave way to dense woodland.
This was most pronounced to the south, where a spring could be found deep inside the woods that slowly developed into a brook, a stream, and eventually a tributary to the river Hal.
The open plains were home to large herds of wild horses, as well as game animals like deer, rabbits and elk.
These species were all hunted by the denizens that resided in the surrounding woods; wolves, beers, ... or worse.

The names of the original settlers have been lost to time, but at some point in history a group of settlers migrated to the area.
Seeing the prospects the land held for farming and hunting, the established a more permanent base in the region, which quickly grew into a small hamlet they named Trawidok.
This modest farming community saw initial success for their labour, digging up the soil in preparation for sowing and ploughing, and making use of the rivers to the west and south for irrigation where necessary.
However the more hunting-oriented members of the community soon realised an inconvenient fact about the local fauna; the dynamic of the game animals residing on the plains and at the mercy of the predators that lurked in the woods had made them skittish to the point of paranoia.
It was incredibly hard to hunt for meat, and even when a hunt was successful the aforementioned predators would be attracted to the party or the village, in search of an easy meal.
The horses native to the plains were similarly terrified of the settlers, and even when captured could not be taught how to take a saddle or harness to aid in the farming or general community's efforts.

A period of particularly harsh winters in consecutive years eventually befell the area.
Trawidok's grain reserves began to run out, and the community became reliant on hunting and foraging to make it through the winter months.
Hunting parties were working round the clock in bitterly cold conditions to sustain the village.
One such hunting party of three people decided to venture into the woods to the South.

Making camp on the outskirts of the woods, they set off following the trail of what looked to be horse-prints in the snow.
They soon came across signs that the horse - or horses - were under pursuit, finding wolf tracks alongside the hoof-prints in the snow, and carcasses that had already been picked clean.
Following the trail, the party eventually heard the sounds of the chase, and caught up to the action shortly afterwards.
Hiding in the foliage, the party could see that the pack of wolves - around 6 strong - had cornered a herd of 3 horses against a rocky outcrop in the woods, and were closing in for the kill.
Sensing an opportunity with the wolves distracted, the hunters stepped out of the foliage and hurled their spears at the wolves, striking down three of them and sending the rest into a panic.
The remaining wolves quickly fled, howling, into the woods.

In dire need of the materials from the wolves that had been killed in the initial strike, the hunters made a break for the wolf corpses near the horses.
The horses remained in place, seemingly now thinking themselves trapped by the hunters instead of the wolves.
However when the hunters reached the dead wolves, they quickly realised their mistake.
The sounds of wolves in the undergrowth had multiplied, and were no longer getting fainter.
The pack returned - vastly outnumbering the hunters and trapping the hunters with the horses, as the horses had been before.

Seeing the approaching wolves, it was at this moment when the hunters felt there was no escape that the horses moved to their sides and lowered their backs, as if signalling the hunters to get on.
Seeing few other options, the hunters obliged, clutching their spoils as they clambered onto the horses' backs.
Once mounted, the horses charged directly at the slowly approaching pack of wolves - the weight of the charge forcing a gap to open for an escape.
The wolf pack gave chase through the woods, but with the hunters mounted and able to fend off the wolves lapping at the horse's heals, the pack was quickly dissuaded from keeping up the pursuit.

With the wolf pack lost, the hunters tried to take stock of where they had ended up, and to get their bearings.
The horses continued moving a short ways, before coming to a halt near a mossy cave entrance, seemingly home to a river spring.
The hunters, sensing their ride was over, dismounted and began to gather themselves, when the horses drew their attention to the cave entrance.

What was emerging from the cave was described as a spirit of the forrest by the hunters.
The whitest horse one had ever seen, seemingly glowing with the outline of its form wispy, as if evaporating into the air.
Seemingly knowing of the flight from the wolves, and how it had been possible thanks to cooperation between person and horse, the spirit offered them the terms of a pact.
Each member of the village would be allowed to attempt to befriend a horse native to the plains, in exchange for said horse's fair treatment as a partner and cooperation in Trawidok's endeavours.
The hunters were to return to the village and extend this offer to the other settlers who wished to take it up.

The hunting party returned, on the three horses they had befriended in the woods, to a relieved and amazed village.
When asked how they had come to "tame" the horses, the hunting party recounted their experience and told of the spirit's offer - and also made it clear that "tame" was the wrong view to have.
With this shared with the village, the horse population of Trawidok rapidly grew making farming, hunting, and defending the village a considerably easier process.

Over time, the tradition of each settler in Trawidok bonding with a horse became a coming-of-age tradition, and the story passed down through word of mouth until eventually written down when the village grew to a size large enough to warrant some formal organisation.
To prove they were ready to contribute to village life as an adult, a villager would venture into the woods to return with their horse companion.
Each person's horse seemed to match to their ambitions - farmers would seemingly happen across shire horses, hunters those more lithe and race oriented horses.
The town militia even gained a small amount of renown in the local area for their unusually cavalry-oriented organisation, and eventually providing some of the best cavalry recruits for the lord's army.
