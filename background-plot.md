## Plot Synopsis

Over the past month, there have been an escalating number of crimes committed against the businesses and citizens of Halfyord.
These crimes have slowly begun to escalate in scale and boldness, though the town guard have since learnt that The Piranhas are behind the attacks, they are also weary that the gang now seems to be aided by magical means.
Furthering the mystery is that the point at which these crimes began coincided with the disappearance of the [Ordinator Ron-Ron](./characters/faire-ron-ron.md) of the Ordo Magicae.

The Piranhas were thought to have been driven off or eliminated over a year ago, when [Captain Shufharz](./characters/shufharz-gra-yamarz.md) lead a remarkably successful and coordinated campaign against the gang throughout Halfyord.
Many high-ranking members were arrested, and the gang's activity all but halted - but their hideout was never discovered and their leader [Shark Carlton](./characters/shark-carlton.md) never apprehended.
Since the gang's responsibility for the crimes was discovered, [Governor Kamonas](./characters/milena-kamonas.md) has ordered Shufharz to make stopping the gang her top priority.

However Shufharz is working with limited resources.
The town guard are not outfitted to deal with large-scale misuse of magic.
The Ordo Magicae has given its support, however the Piranhas seem to have premeditated their resurgence and have been targeting shipments carrying magical materials or alchemical reagents, which means that what the Ordo can produce for the guard is limited.

As the citizenry of Halfyord continue to grow angry at the lack of results; the Ordo Magicae continues to put pressure on about their missing Ordinator, and the merchant trade that Halfyord depends on has begun to dwindle, Shufharz has come up with a plan.
She plans to allow the Piranhas to catch word of a large shipment of wealthy goods arriving at the docks, and when the gang strikes, to track them back to their hideout and root them out once and for all.
But for this plan to work, she needs the help of a group of adventurers who are unknown to the town - and thus the gang - as she knows the gang is not reckless enough to walk directly into a trap.

## Background

Whilst the town of Halfyord has a long and storied history, the plot-relevant events begin approximately 2 years into the past from when the adventure starts.

### Decline of the Piranhas

Approximately two years ago, several smaller criminal gangs in Halfyord banded together to form the Piranhas.
At the time, Halfyord only had a local militia for law enforcement, and most positions of rank within the militia and city administration were handed out based on merit.
This created a situation that the new gang was quick to exploit; relying on bribes to city officials and prominent citizens for legal immunity, they were quick to take de-facto control of the town's imports and exports, extort any merchant travellers and local businesses, and run shady "escapist" businesses that preyed on the general gloom of the local population.

The situation in Halfyord was bought to the attention of the Lord by a travelling merchant who had passed through Halfyord on their way to the capital.
It had already been noted that the tax revenue from the town was lower than previous years, and the merchant's testimony of their experience in the town was enough to prompt action.
However, it took around 6 months of political manoeuvring and espionage for the Lord to be in a position to appoint Kamonas as the new governor of Halfyord.
The change in leadership was necessary, as enough evidence had been gathered to implicate the previous governor in taking bribes from the gang.
Upon Kamonas' appointment, she insisted that Shufharz transfer with her to take the (new) role of captain of the guard.

Shortly after their arrival to Halfyord, Shufharz began organising an extensive - but expensive - campaign against the Piranhas; investigating other city officials and citizens suspected of being in the employ of the gang, reforming the town militia into a professional garrison, and raids on shady businesses thought to support the gang's finances.
Over the course of several months, the Piranhas were slowly strangled out of Halfyord.
Many high-ranking members of the gang had been arrested, and their contacts within the city elite had been arrested to prevent any legal immunity.
With the gang appearing to have dissolved or broken apart, Shufharz' campaign against them was ended, though her reforms to the guard were retained to protect Halfyord's interests in the future.
The honest citizens and merchant class of Halfyord saw the campaign as a major success - and the popularity of Shufharz and Kamonas skyrocketed.
The two of them were aware however, that the gang's leader (Shark Carlton) had not been apprehended, and his whereabouts were unknown and never fully uncovered.
After a year of no signs of activity from the gang however, it was assumed that Carlton had managed to flee Halfyord when he realised the way the wind was blowing, or had hidden sufficiently well that the investigation never managed to pinpoint him.

### A New Ordinator

The Ordo Magicae has maintained some form of presence in Halfyord for two decades.
Whilst the guild does maintain a nominal "guildhall" within the town, it is little more than a shop front that provides the guild with some revenue, and a helpful outpost to acquire reagents and materials from the many merchants that travel through the town.
It is for this reason that some members of the Ordo refer to the guild's building in Halfyord as an "outpost" rather than a "guildhall".
All guildhalls are run by an Ordinator, however in the case of Halfyord this means that the role is predominantly an administrative one, not an academic one.
As such, it is seen as something of a "retirement position" for older members of the Ordo who are no longer active in their research, though it could also serve as a breakthrough "first appointment" for an Apprentice within the guild.

Faire Ron-Ron's is one such academic nearing the end of their career.
They are widely known outside academic circles for their past work in a number of fields of magic, however those within academic circles know that Faire's research has ground almost to a standstill in terms of innovation.
He has become rather egotistical and as such fails to see the decline in his personal work himself, increasingly relying on the work of his Apprentices to continue publishing and supporting his career.
Apprentices are not short of the ground for Faire either, due to the reputation of his aforementioned prior work.

The higher ranking members of the Ordo eventually reasoned that Faire's egotistical nature, combined with the general decline in the quality of his personal research output, was hurting the talent within the guild more than it was helping bring in new members.
As such, about a year ago he was politically assigned the post of Ordinator at the Ordo Magicae outpost in Halfyord.
They knew that Faire would view this as a promotion - he would be in charge of the outpost in its entirely, be given the right to transfer to his own lab with an Apprentice, and thus appear to gain a lot of prestige upon his appointment.
However, those within the Ordo who sponsored his "promotion" knew about the more administrative nature of the role he was getting, which would also get Faire away from the major guildhalls and thus from sucking up all the incoming talent and latching on to their research efforts.

Faire transferred to Halfyord along with his Apprentice, [Groubun Stoneclimber](./characters/groubun-stoneclimber.md), replacing the old Ordinator who moved on to another position within the guild.
Whilst this has had the intended effect for the rest of the Ordo, it has made Groubun's and the other staff members at the Halfyord outpost - such as [Acolyte Jenessa](./characters/jenessa.md)'s - lives considerably worse.
Faire shirks his administrative duties and frivolously wastes the supplies the outpost procures on his experiments that are going nowhere.
This leads to Jenessa and the other guild members being "delegated" this work that should be handled by the Ordinator himself.
Groubun in particular suffers from Faire "leeching" off his work, playing into the academic standard that an Apprentice should include their supervisor in all their academic papers and reports.
All the while Faire is in Halfyord, Groubun is also stuck here too as his Apprentice, but no longer has access to the larger laboratories and academic colleagues he has prior to his transfer.
He has also succeeded in annoying Shufharz when the two have been present at council meetings, and is also on poor terms with the wealthier citizens who also make up the council due to his egotistical nature and unwillingness to listen to the ideas of others.
Kamonas is largely neutral towards him, as insofar he has been cooperative with her administration (though unbeknownst to her, the other members of the guildhall are actually doing the work which Faire reports as his own).

### A Bitter Apprentice

Faire still believes himself to be pushing the boundaries of magical research - and whilst his knowledge was once considered extensive, he is now both behind the times and out of his depth.
His obliviousness to this fact, combined with his egotistical nature, have resulted in him neglecting his wider duties as Ordinator, the responsibility of which has fallen onto Jenessa and Groubun.
It has also caused Groubun to become bitter towards his supervisor - many of Groubun's achievements are forced to carry Faire's name by association, and Faire is often assumed to be the one who should be given the bulk of the credit.
Groubun also had ambitions to move up in the Ordo, which he know realises have been halted given his supervisor's current position.
He also realises the divergence in his and his supervisor's interest; Groubun has always been more of an alchemist and artificer, whilst Faire is more focused on direct manipulation of the weave of magic.

Groubun has become a regular at the Day's Rest Tavern over the past few months, as he enjoys the card games that are often run there and has struck up a friendship with the barkeeper, Fordem.

### Broken Teeth

After seeing the writing on the wall during Shufharz' earlier campaign, Shark Carlton and some of his inner circle - notably including [Foredem Chev](./characters/fordem-chev.md) - started to make contingency plans.
These higher-ranking members of the gang orchestrated the purchase of The Day's Rest tavern, going to great lengths to acquire the necessary documentation either legally or through more illicit - but untraceable - means.
The original owner of the tavern was already in debt to the gang due to their extortionate rates on the local businesses, so was easily intimidated into selling for significantly less than the market price in exchange for the erasure of his debt.
This - if anything - is one of the more obvious clues that the gang may have ties to the tavern itself, however this detail was lost in the corruption of the city administration before Shufharz could stamp it out completely.

The gang have since "amped up" the facade of the tavern front - Fordem runs the bar and is the "legal" owner of the building, and they also made sure to keep the old waitress ([Hope](./characters/hope.md)) employed to make the purchase seem like a genuine ownership transfer.
All of the bouncers employed are gang members however, and most of the taverns rooms are rented out to members of the gang as well.
They have also undertaken renovations to the cellar of the tavern, fashioning it into a headquarters for the gang which to this day remains their only hideout.
Shark Carlton resides almost full-time within the hideout and tavern, in hiding due to his prominence in the gang's golden years and being under de-facto house arrest due to fear of being recognised on the streets by the (now better equipped) city guard.
Carlton is also in a tight spot; the wealth that the gang managed to preserve from their high-days has started to run dry, and whilst the tavern generates some income, there is always the worry that a member (or ex-member) might have a change of heart and tip off the city guard if the aren't paid on time.
Carlton and Fordem believe the best course of action is to relocate the gang somewhere else, but again the gang now lack the funds and faith in the general loyalty of the other members to put this in motion.

### The Deal

Fordem noted the increasing frequency of Groubun's visits to the tavern, and made strides to befriend the dwarf, sensing an opportunity.
Carlton and Fordem sensed an opportunity in Groubun's situation to give the gang an edge - an ally in the Ordo Magicae could provide all kinds of assistance to the gang, if there was something they could offer in return.
After a few months, and once Fordem was convinced that Groubun would be open to entertaining the notion of a deal with a known criminal gang, they extended to him a deal.

Groubun was initially hesitant, knowing Carlton by reputation but being enticed by his "friendship" with Fordem and the opportunity to get his career back on track.
Groubun needed Faire to disappear; doing so would make him acting Ordinator in the intermediary period, allowing him to demonstrate his aptitude for the role and hopefully work himself a promotion out of Halfyord and get his career back on track.
But it couldn't be as simple as Faire disappearing permanently; if Faire turned up dead there would surely be a wider investigation from the Ordo and local authorities, but he had to be out of the picture long enough to give Groubun a chance at the Ordinator role.

The Piranhas' needs were more direct - they needed a source of income, and they needed to be able to offer easy work to their members.
They also maintained their intention of raising enough funds in a (relatively) short time to relocate themselves out of the town.
Fortunately, Groubun was in a position to provide them with the magical equipment and potions they might need to do just that.
Groubun could provide the gang with the edge they needed to steal the wealth they desired, and in turn the gang could strike out at shipments carrying the materials that Groubun would need to create more potions and magical gear.
The brazen use of magic would coincide with the disappearance of an Ordinator who had fallen out with most of the city elite, and if Faire was left alive the gang could leave suitable evidence to frame him upon their eventual escape.

There was one problem with kidnapping Faire and keeping him in captivity; despite being past his academic prime, he was still a wizard of notable talent, so would be notoriously difficult to keep locked up.
An escape story would also be all the more believable, and have disastrous consequences for all of the conspirators.
Eventually, Groubun's desire for revenge gave him an idea; Faire was only dangerous whilst he was able to cast spells, so if he could be forced into a temporary form that prevented him from casting, he could be contained.
In Groubun's mind there was also some small joy in knowing that Faire would be able to see this plan unfolding before his eyes, and be helpless to stop it.

Eventually a plan was conceived:

- Groubun would create a potion of true polymorph, and administer it to Faire. With Groubun's expertise in potion making, it would be not be difficult to ensure the effects of the potion could only be undone with an antidote or administration of magic directly. This antidote could also conveniently include the memory wipe necessary.
- The animal Faire would then be delivered to the Day's Rest to live as the tavern pet, whilst the gang prepared the fake evidence and restarted their operations.
- During this time, Groubun would provide the means to aid the Piranhas' criminal endeavours. The gang would conversely resupply him in secret, by hitting shipments coming to Halfyord carrying the necessary materials in addition to more traditional targets.
- Once Carlton was confident the Piranhas were in a position to relocate themselves (with enough capital to fund their activities elsewhere), and the "evidence" was ready, they would leave Halfyord. Faire would be planted in the gang's old hideout, his memory of his life as an animal wiped, and the guards tipped off. Faire's career would be ruined, Groubun would have a chance to prove himself and get his career back on track, and Carlton and the gang would have escaped Halfyord to restart their activities elsewhere.

### The Past Month

Groubun did not find it difficult to make the necessary potion, having access to the materials within the Ordo as Faire's Apprentice.
Knowing Faire would not be able to - nor care to - identify the potion, and the other members of staff would not have the time nor concern, its creation was relatively easy.
One evening when working in the lab with Faire, Groubun spiked his drink with the potion, and all it took was for Faire to finish his drink before the transformation took place.
Faire had turned into an animal he had a soft spot for - a humble cat.
Confused by his new form, it was not much trouble for Groubun to scoop up Faire, shove him into a pre-prepared (silenced!) container, and take him across to the Day's Rest.
From there, the plan was in motion.

After waiting about a week for Faire's disappearance to be reported and make its way through town, the Piranhas began setting their plans in motion.
They initially started with small scale robberies, however quickly escalated to more prominent targets once they realised the extent of Groubun's magical assistance.
Groubun's aid to the gang mostly came in the form of potions and low-level magic items, since these did not depend on the user's magical prowess and thus could be wielded by any member of the gang.
Invisibility potions proved particularly useful, but potions of animate objects proved even more go: an invisible thief had a much easier time breaking and entering, and animate objects could be used to make small but expensive items like coins, jewellery, and gems smuggle themselves out of a shop or home!

With the Piranhas able to revitalise their operations, and seeing the relatively helpless situation the guard find themselves in, they have also grown in boldness.
The original small-scale thefts of small valuables have given way to more ambitious heists - shops were robbed during the night seemingly without any signs of break _ins_, only break _outs_.
A week before the adventure takes place, an attempt was made on the town treasury in the magistrate's office.
This heist was partially successful; Shufharz and the guards managed to arrive on the scene after being alerted by the silent alarm (spells) that protected the vault.
They reported having to fend off animated beasts seemingly made of silver, jade, and other expensive materials, which when struck seemed to break down into coins, gems, and other components that made up part of the treasury.
Whilst the theft was interrupted, no gang members were arrested and part of the treasury was lost - a careless gang member did drop a silver tooth trinket in the escape though.
Combined with the previous reputation of the Piranhas, this was enough to implicate the gang, and place the finger of suspicion on the conveniently disappeared Ordinator - though Shufharz and Kamonas have little else to go on.

Groubun has also focused the time he has for research on ensuring the plan goes smoothly, fashioning a collar for the now-cat Faire to ward him against dispelling magic, and confining him to wandering the premises of the Day's Rest Tavern.
Hope has taken a liking to Fordem's new pet, which Fordem claims he found as a stray wandering the streets and has taken in.
This also explains away the bad behaviour of said pet, and the need for a collar.
Hope does not know the cat is Faire, nor is she aware that the collar wards Faire from external magic and keeps him confined to the Day's Rest.
Fordem is not thrilled to have Faire wandering his tavern as a pet, but allows it after Faire managed to escape out of the cellar, Hope saw him wandering the upper floors of the Day's Rest, and Fordem needed an explanation.

### Entrapment

With the gang bold enough to make an attempt on the town's treasury, Shufharz has bought forward her plan to lure out the Piranhas' base of operations.
She and Kamonas have arranged for a shipment of inexpensive goods to arrive at the docks this week.
However they have deliberately spread rumours that the shipment is actually carrying freshly minted coins, gems, and other valuables like silks and furs.
This is in the hopes that the Piranhas will be enticed to strike, and can then be tracked back to their hideout.
However, they are worried about how much the Piranhas know, so have taken to hiring trusted contacts from outside Halfyord to take part in the masquerade rather than using members of the guard.

The scale of the heists that the gang has been pulling off first made Carlton and Fordem apprehensive, for fear that the escalation would bring too much attention too quickly.
This fear has since evaporated due to the vast successes the gang has enjoyed, and they have come to the conclusion that the faster they can accumulate wealth, the faster they can get out of Halfyord.
As such; they are planning to strike at the shipment they have heard so much about, but are also planning to strike at the Great Market Square, at the height of the market day, hoping to round off the funds they need in as short a time frame as possible.

### The Present Day

The adventure starts one day before the shipment that Shufharz and Kamonas have arranged is due to dock in Halfyord.

## Timeline

A summary of important events that lead up to the present day.

- 5+ years ago: several of Halfyords small-time criminal gangs band together to form the Piranhas. Somewhat influential amongst the new gang's members is [Fordem Chev](./characters/fordem-chev.md), and an up-and-coming [Carlton](./characters/shark-carlton.md).
- 5 years ago: [Hope](./characters/hope.md) arrives in Halfyord and eventually finds work at the Day's Rest Tavern.
- 3.5 years ago: Carlton, with the backing of Fordem, makes a power play for control of the Piranhas gang and comes out as the undisputed leader.
- 3 years ago: the Piranhas become the criminal gang largely in control of Halfyord's illicit trades. They start to expand their influence into the city elite, and tightening their grip on the local businesses and trade caravans / fleets.
- 2.5 years ago: the Piranhas are in de-facto control of Halfyord. The local Lord takes note and begins an investigation, recalling [Kamonas](./characters/milena-kamonas.md) from her current assignment.
- 2 years ago: Sufficient evidence of corruption is bought against Halfyord's governor, who is deposed in favour of Kamonas. Kamonas appoints [Shufharz](./characters/shufharz-gra-yamarz.md) as head of the city guard and the two set to work dismantling the Piranha's operation.
- 1.75 years ago: Fordem Chev strong-arms the owner of the Day's Rest into selling to the Piranhas, keeping the transaction largely above board where possible. Seeing the way the wind is blowing, he and Carlton begin the process of creating a new base of operations - and hideout - with the tavern as a front, to avoid arrest and execution.
- 1.5 years ago: The Piranhas have ceased to be an effective force, and have lost their grip on Halfyord. The remaining members go into hiding, with Fordem assuming the alias of a barkeep at the Day's Rest to disguise Carlton's new hideout. They conduct small-scale petty theft, but are careful not to draw more attention to themselves and have lost the ability to conduct operations on the scale they had before.
- 1.25 years ago: [Faire Ron-Ron](./characters/faire-ron-ron.md) is promoted to the position of Ordinator and moves to Halfyord with his Apprentice, [Groubun Stoneclimber](./characters/groubun-stoneclimber.md). They join the existing staff, including long-serving member [Jenessa](./characters/jenessa.md), at the Ordo Magicae guildhall.
- 6 months ago: Faire has managed to annoy almost all of the city council and the staff at the Ordo through his personality and attitude. Groubun has taken to venting his anger at the Day's Rest, which is a tavern he frequents.
- 2 months ago: Fordem invites Groubun to a meeting with Carlton, to discuss how they can help each other.
- 5-6 weeks ago: Groubun administers Faire a potion of polymorph, and delivers him to the Piranhas, along with potions and other equipment to aid their activities.
- 5 weeks ago: Faire's disappearance is widespread news in Halfyord. The Ordo Magicae is cooperating with the town guard's investigation, and Groubun is acting as Ordinator temporarily.
- 4 weeks ago: The Piranhas restart their criminal activities in ernest. Things start off small, but gradually escalate as it becomes clear the guard do not have a ready way to counter the new threat.
- 1 week ago: The Piranhas make their attempt on the town treasury. Though partially successful, the gang does implicate themselves as the perpetrators of the recent crime spree.
- 1 week ago: Shufharz begins preparations for her plan to track down the Piranhas base of operations, though it will not be ready for some time.
- Present day: The Piranhas conduct an audacious attack on the Great Market Square, in broad daylight.
