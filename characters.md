The Piranhas of Halfyord features eight notable NPCs, one major faction (the Piranhas gang), and one notable cat (Whiskers).
To avoid spreading character introductions throughout the scenes and plot summary, we have included them here.
There is also a [spoiler-free character summary](./appendix/appendix-character-summary.md) in the appendix, which can be handed out to players right from the get-go of the adventure (of if you prefer, [after the briefing](./scenes/02-hired-help.md#brief-with-the-governor) once the market attack is over).

Broadly speaking, the characters fall into four loosely defined groups;

- The city officials; Kamonas and Shufharz,
- The Ordo Magicae members; Faire, Groubun, and Jenessa,
- The Piranhas Gang; consisting of Shark Carlton and (unbeknownst to the players) Fordem,
- Citizens of Halfyord; whose only notable member with relevance to the adventure is Hope.

There is of course some overlap between the groups; Faire's position as Ordinator (and Groubun as acting Ordinator) gives them a place on the city council, Groubun is also in league with the Piranhas, and Fordem is masquerading as a normal barkeeper.

Even within these groups, the goals of the characters do not perfectly align.
For example, Shufharz and Kamonas both want the Piranhas' attacks to stop, but Shufharz is wants to achieve this by getting rid of the remaining Piranhas members once and for all, whilst Kamonas will be happy if they are just driven off.

## Character Profiles

You can find the character profiles for each NPC below.
Each character has a short backstory, physical description, a summary of their relations to the other characters, and some notes on any plot-relevant knowledge they have.
Stat-blocks are also provided, though beyond Carlton, Fordem, and possibly Groubun, those of the other characters should not be necessary.
