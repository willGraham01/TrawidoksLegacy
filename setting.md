This section describes the village of Trawidok and the surrounding area, where the adventure was originally intended to take place.
The area that the adventure takes place in is deliberately designed to be somewhat self-contained, to allow the adventure to be "insertable" into larger games or longer-running campaigns, and some aspects of the descriptions below are left deliberately vague.
There is deliberately no mention of the state or wider governing body that Trawidok belongs to, and its only geographic features are presented in relation to the [town of Halfyord](https://willgraham01.github.io/PiranhasHalfyord).

DMs should feel free to expand on the descriptions given here, or adapt them as necessary to suit their needs or personal campaigns and games.
A more detailed discussion of the core mechanics that the story depends on, and how to change the appearance of the adventure without changing the underlying store is given in the [customising the adventure](./customising.md) section.

Some locations that the players are intended to visit during the adventure have detailed descriptions and floor-plans, since the party is expected to explore and interact with these environments in depth during the story.
These locations are given a short summary in the sections below.
Maps are available for download in the [mapped locations](#mapped-locations) section.

## Trawidok

FIXME:use-the-map-in-floorplans!

Trawidok itself is a an odd mixture of a farming village and derby ground.
The core of the village is comprised of a three main streets that originate at a village square.
These streets head south, north-east and north-west from the square and into the surrounding plains, before more rugged trails and footpaths break off from them as one gets further from the village.
Most of the buildings are humble, one-story dwellings, possibly with basements dug into the ground.
There are - by nature of Trawidok's history - a large number of stables and horse-tying stations throughout the village.
The village square has a well and small statue at its centre, and is one of the few areas of the town that is paved (though with cobblestones rather than solid-slab pavement).
There is a general store located just off the square, an inn halfway along the north-westerly street, and a blacksmith who mostly specialises in craft and repair of tools and horseshoes has a forge and store-front on the north-east end of the town.
The three streets, and structures that join to them are known as the "old town" by the local residents.

Beyond the core of the village, there are many farming houses and trapper posts in the plains and hills that surround Trawidok who would consider themselves residents of the village.
The "natural boundary" of Trawidok is drawn by the river Hal to the east, and the woodland areas that encompass the plains and hills on the south, west, and north.
The southern woodlands are the source of the Halbrook, a tributary river that runs west to east and joins the Hal a good distance before it reaches Halfyord.
The woodlands quickly become thick upon entry, and it is considered unwise to wander off the main roads and trails without local guides or knowledge of the area.

The plains and rolling hills that surround the old village lend themselves to an agriculture-based existence, and Trawidok is something of a bread-basket region for the surrounding area.
Most of its surplus harvest is exported via Halfyord's connections, and the area has a reputation for being bountiful if slightly quaint and rugged.
In recent years this has changed somewhat, with the building of the racecourse, boarding house, and derby stables on the south-west side of the town.
In fact, these structures stick out like a sore thumb from the rest of the village, being much grander in design and appearance than the rest of the village.
This has turned Trawidok into something of a holiday destination for the upper classes and nobility, due to the attraction that the races present, though this has caused [friction with the more traditional townsfolk](FIXME link to character motivations etc).

### Population demograph

FIXME
The population of Halfyord is diverse; humans make up the most common species and the original settlers, but nowadays elves and dwarves also make up a sizeable chunk of the population.
The town has a local governor (magistrate) and a number of the wealthier merchants sit on the town council, though ultimately the town is still ruled over - and pays taxes to - a Lord whose capital is elsewhere.
The demeanour of the residents is open and welcoming to the untrained eye, but the merchants are professionals with profit foremost in mind, which has lead most of the lower-class citizens to be weary of being taken for a fool.

Many of the lower-class citizens are dock workers, or work in one of the various taverns and boarding houses that are sustained by the travelling merchants.
Most of these residents will reside on the east bank, which is predominantly composed of permanent housing and small street markets offering food, clothing, and other essential materials for everyday life.
The streets are narrower and "more lively" at night than on the west bank, but are by no means in dire disrepair.

The wealthier citizens typically reside on the west bank, in slightly grander detached houses compared to the terraced houses that make up the majority of the east bank.
The elite live in mansion houses that line the main street running from the market square to the magistrates office.
All businesses that are based in the town and have a permanent premises are found on this side of the river too.

## Mapped Locations

Not all scenes in the story have a map provided, which is typically true of the locations where the party's interactions are (expected to be) limited to social interactions or investigations.
Areas of Halfyord that the party visits multiple times, or whose layout is useful to visualise (due to potential combat encounters, or spatial reasoning) are provided here for use.
They have been designed to try and be faithful to the descriptions of the areas given above, and should contain the necessary features that the scenes in the story refer to as holding clues or other sources of information for the party.

All maps give the number of 5ft-by-5ft squares that make up the map, and each map is given to a scale of 50px = one 5ft-by-5ft square.

These maps were made using [DungeonScrawl](https://www.dungeonscrawl.com/), if you want to tweak certain features of the map you can contact the maintainers and we can provide the corresponding `.ds` file.

- [The Great Market Square](./floorplans/market-50px-per-square-36x33.png), 36 (W) by 33 (H) squares. This map is meant to only represent one quarter of the market square, which is why some features abruptly end.
- [The Ordo Magicae Outpost](./floorplans/ordo-outpost-50px-per-square-34x59.png), 34 (W) by (59) squares. The map is divided into the 3 floors of the building, with the ground floor at the bottom of the map and the top floor at the top.
- [The Docks](./floorplans/docks-50px-per-square-75x48.png), 75 (W) by 48 (H) squares. This only represents the relevant docking station and it's connections to the main bridge over Halford. The bridge underpass is provided off to the left of the map as its own small area, since the bridge itself overlaps with the underpass when viewed from above.
- [The Day's Rest Tavern](./floorplans/days-rest-interior_31x33.png), 31 (W) by 33 (H) squares. A trapdoor is used to represent the cellar door entrance, though this could just as well be a regular door depending on the flavour you want to apply.
- [The Piranhas Hideout](./floorplans/hideout-50px-per-square-32x36.png) 32 (W) by (36) squares. The crack in the wall from Calton's room into the sewers is not represented.
