This section describes the town of Halfyord, where the adventure was originally intended to take place.
The town is deliberately designed to be somewhat self-contained, to allow the adventure to be "insertable" into larger games or longer-running campaigns, and some aspects of the descriptions below are left deliberately vague.
In particular, there is deliberately no mention of the state or wider governing body that Halfyord belongs to, the major settlements that it trades with or is situated between, and the details about the Ordo Magicae are deliberately limited just to the organisational structure within the town's guildhall itself.

DMs should feel free to expand on the descriptions given here, or adapt them as necessary to suit their needs or personal campaigns and games.
A more detailed discussion of the core mechanics that the story depends on, and how to change the appearance of the adventure without changing the underlying store is given in the [customising the adventure](./customising.md) section.

Some locations within Halfyord have detailed descriptions and floorplans, since the party is expected to explore and interact with these environments in depth during the story.
These locations are given a short summary in the [following section](#halfyord), and maps are available for download in the [mapped locations](#mapped-locations) section.

## Halfyord

Halfyord is a prosperous town that straddles both sides of the river Hal, which runs north to south through the town and split it into two (referred to as the east and west bank).
The town started off as a small fishing town that ran a ferry commissions for travellers looking to cross the banks of the Hal.
Over time, the town grew in importance and size as the number of travellers increased and the surrounding roads and trade routes began to develop.
This eventually lead to the construction of the bridge that joins both sides of the town, as well as the docks that facilitates maritime trade up and down the Hal river itself.
The town is now walled on both sides of the river, though there are no lock-gates on the river itself.
The main road that leads from the east gate to the bridge, then on past the market square and to the west gate, is the widest road in the town and is always in pristine condition and well-lit by lampposts.
The surrounding countryside is used for farming and subsidence agriculture, and houses a number of hamlets and farmsteads that fall under the town's administration.

The population of Halfyord is diverse; humans make up the most common species and the original settlers, but nowadays elves and dwarves also make up a sizeable chunk of the population.
The town has a local governor (magistrate) and a number of the wealthier merchants sit on the town council, though ultimately the town is still ruled over - and pays taxes to - a Lord whose capital is elsewhere.
The demeanour of the residents is open and welcoming to the untrained eye, but the merchants are professionals with profit foremost in mind, which has lead most of the lower-class citizens to be weary of being taken for a fool.

Many of the lower-class citizens are dock workers, or work in one of the various taverns and boarding houses that are sustained by the travelling merchants.
Most of these residents will reside on the east bank, which is predominantly composed of permanent housing and small street markets offering food, clothing, and other essential materials for everyday life.
The streets are narrower and "more lively" at night than on the west bank, but are by no means in dire disrepair.

The wealthier citizens typically reside on the west bank, in slightly grander detached houses compared to the terraced houses that make up the majority of the east bank.
The elite live in mansion houses that line the main street running from the market square to the magistrates office.
All businesses that are based in the town and have a permanent premises are found on this side of the river too.

### The Docks

Situated on the west bank of the river are the docks, with the commercial docks being separated from the merchant docks by the bridge.
A small underpass runs underneath the bridge that links the two areas of the docks.
The docks are generally safe all times, with city watch members patrolling at all times of day - though with a reduced presence at night.

The commercial docks to the south of the bridge still run ferry services across the Hal, as well as recreational trips or fishing expeditions.
Ferry services also run along the river to the settlements up and downstream from Halfyord.
The wealthier members of Halfyord's society also dock private vessels here.
It typically sees a lot of activity in the early mornings and late afternoons of the working days, as citizens of the city need to commute to and from work.

The merchant docks to the north of the bridge see a large amount of activity, seeing a large number of goods passing through in both directions each week.
Large warehouses line the docks and back onto the town streets behind, with cranes and other lifting machinery being present at a number of docking stations along the bank.

The portion of the docks that the party will be concerned with the mooring station in the commercial side of the docks, closest to the town bridge, which is where they will [scout in the evening](./scenes/04-scouting-the-docks.md) and then be present for [the plant the following day](./scenes/06-planted-cargo.md).
A winding, sloped road runs across the bridge and then splits at a junction, with one of these split roads running parallel to the mooring station and serving as an access road to the commercial docks with various slip-roads that break off to the various mooring stations.
The bridge is approximately 50ft higher than the docks platform, with the mooring stations being closer to the water still to allow ships to dock at them.
There is also a spiral staircase that descends from the bridge itself to the docks, exiting out onto the docks platform near the docking crane and the bridge underpass.

Nestled in the square-like area that the road wraps around is the docking crane and various containers and crates that are presumably used for loading.
This area sits on a raised platform approximately 1m above the docks, with a small access ramp providing access from the docking platform.
The crane itself sits on a turntable, and is operated by a series of levers, winches, and pulleys - there is usually a dedicated team of dockworkers coordinating this operation.
A small, square platform is attached to the arm of the crane which is used for loading and unloading ships - the reach of this arm extends comfortably over the mooring station.
On the map, the crane is only represented by its turntable, in the upper-left corner.

The docking platform itself has the river on one side and is lined with a series of warehouses, crane platforms, and mooring stations.
Of concern to the adventure is the warehouse & mooring station closest to the town bridge.
The mooring station consists of a straight platform like one might see on a canal, with hitching posts that boats can attach to.
It sits slightly closer to the water level of the river than the main docks platform, again accessed via a short ramp which is approximately 60-100ft from the bridge underpass.
The mooring station itself has nothing remarkable about it, whilst the warehouse is a two-story building that can be accessed from the docking platform via a double doorway, and has a single window with shutters that also faces out over the docking platform on the upper floor.
Inside the warehouse is a massive supply of empty boxes and crates, covered with tarpaulins, which have been pushed to the back and sides of the warehouse floor.
There is a small workstation in the back right corner of the ground floor that looks to house various repair and woodworking tools for use during loading.
A staircase runs up the wall next to the workstation to get to the upper floor, which much like the lower floor contains a few empty crates and tarpaulins (though of a smaller size).

The segment of the docking platform that is used in the adventure extends approximately 150ft from the bridge underpass.

### The Great Market Square

On the west side of the river, visible from the docks, sits the Great Market Square.
It is open to the air, and centres on a statue of the town founder, atop a large fountain.
The square itself is approximately 500 ft on both sides, with markings on the ground indicating areas that should be left open as pathways, and other areas that can be occupied by merchants.

The great market square has no permanent stands, and traders have to wheel their own carts or stalls in to sell their wares.
Permission to trade in the square is often acquired when first entering the town or by visiting the magistrates office, and typically lasts the week.
The square is also typically where businesses will go to negotiate and finalise deals, or to source a supplier of goods who has setup a temporary stand.

Governor's Walk is the street that runs from the Great Market Square directly to the Magistrate's office and attached barracks.
The main road through town linking the west and east gate passes along the southern edge of the square.

### The Ordo Magicae Outpost

Halfyord is large enough to warrant a permanent outpost for the Ordo Magicae, located to the south of the Great Market Square.
It is a detached building, much like most of the buildings on the west bank, but is not as grand as a full guildhall.

The permanent staff consist of a fully qualified mage who runs the outpost, holding the title of Ordinator.
Their Apprentice is typically next in the chain of command, and the remaining staff are administrative or predominantly attendants to the Ordinator.

The ground floor hosts a shop front that offers access to basic off-the-shelf potions and mundane magical items, as well as services such as identification or enchantment commissions - though the latter is typically unaffordable except by the town elite or wealthy adventurers.
The ground floor is approximately a 75-by-75ft square in terms of floor space.
A shop desk is situated across the ground floor from the street entrance, in clear view so that whoever is behind the desk can see customers entering the shop.
There are a number of display tables, shelves, and cases on the shop floor, as well as bookcases containing journal articles by members of the guildhall, as well as more standard textbook like tomes for sale.
In the left-hand corner of the floor (after entering from the street) is a small waiting area that customers may wait in when they request specific magic items or services (like silvering or enchanting).
The "top right" corner of the floor is section off into it's own small room, accessible through a locked doorway.
This contains the stairway to the next floor, and is also a temporary storage location for tables and other display cases that are currently not in use on the main shop floor.

The first floor hosts a communal living space, rooms for the lower-ranking permanent staff members and visiting guild members, and the laboratory.
Entering the floor from the shop floor places a person in the communal living space, an approximately 50ft-by-40ft rectangular room ("wider" than it is "tall" when viewed from top-down).
Directly across the room from this staircase is another set of stairs leading to the top floor.
The communal space has a kitchenette-style area, are fireplace with some comfy looking chairs and rugs, and a more practical dining table.
There is also a notice board fixed to the long wall opposite the kitchenette area, that has various guild-related announcements and news articles pinned to it.
The communal space has a doorway to the lab in the opposite corner to the stairs from the shop floor, and a smaller doorway to the living quarters on the short wall opposite the staircases.

The communal space is actually just a narrow corridor that runs along the (opposite side of the) short wall of the communal space, with some small rooms that each open out into the corridor.
These rooms are for the lower-ranking members of the guild, and one is kept free for guests if any members of the Ordo are visiting.
They each have a bed, wardrobe and chest of draws, and a small side table for the bed.
There is also a restroom in the corridor.

The laboratory is primarily for members of the guild to conduct experiments in, and to use when manufacturing items commissioned through the store-front on the ground floor, but is also where the guild stores its alchemical reagents and magical components (such as gems).
It shares one of its walls with one of the long walls of the communal space, and almost has as much floor space.
In the centre of the lab is a single table that has multiple workstations, each with different pieces of kit setup for experiments.
Though it is intended that equipment not being used be put away in the cupboards and shelves that line the outer walls of the lab, in practice a lot of frequently-used equipment is left out on the main table.
The outer walls are designed to maximise storage, and are packed with shelves, bookcases, and cabinets - there are even some wires that have alchemical reagents hanging overhead and growing off them.
There are two desks in the far corners (from the entrance) that are used by the Ordinator and their Apprentice.
These desks typically contain experimental logbooks, draft manuscripts, and the remains of food or drink that can't be taken near the experiments.

The second (top) floor has rooms for the Ordinator and their Apprentice.
Accessing it from the staircase in the communal area of the floor below will place a person into a corridor that the two rooms open out onto, along with another restroom.

The two rooms on this floor are quarters for the Ordinator and their Apprentice, and have slightly nicer accommodations and more spacious layouts.
Each have a hearth, floor-to-ceiling wardrobe, separate chest of draws, and study desk.
The Ordinator's room also has some comfy armchairs and multiple bedside tables.

### The Magistrates Office and Barracks

The magistrates office is the public-facing courthouse, as well as the place of residence for the local governor.
It is built at the end of Governor's Walk, the main street leading directly to the Great Market Square and lined with mansion houses owned by the city elite, most of which are on the city council in some capacity.
It is a large building - most likely the largest in town - and has exquisite architectural features and is always immaculately decorated and clean.

Due to how the town grew from its humble origins, the barracks and jail form part of the same structure as the council chambers and governor's residence.
The main entrance now leads into a lobby and the council chambers (on the ground floor), with the governor's residence on the upper floor.
The barracks is mostly accessed through a side-entrance that is not visible from the front of the building, with the jail entirely underground beneath this part of the building.
The upper floors of the barracks home the city guard who do not own a residence inside the city, as well as providing modest quarters for the captain of the town guard.

### The Temple

Halfyord is home to an ecumenical temple to no particular deity, which is open to public worship and holds sermons on weekends.
It can be found on the eastern bank of the Hal, on the edge of the residential suburbs near the city wall.

The temple itself is more akin to a chapel, being barely taller than most houses on the east bank, though tall enough for its clock tower to be visible from the main street.
Beyond the chapel structure itself, there are some modest grounds which consist primarily of gardens that the clergy tend to, and some small buildings that function as a vicarage - the clergy lives there, and they can provide cramped if functional lodgings for pilgrims and visiting priests, paladins, and the like.
It is also the de-facto hospital for the town, and gets most of its herbal supplies from the herbalist store on the other side of the river, and occasionally potions or other healing substances from the Ordo Outpost.

The temple is funded mostly by donations from pilgrims on their way to holy sites of greater import, and the healing services it provides.

### The Day's Rest Tavern

The Day's Rest is one of several taverns that can be found on the east bank of Halfyord.
It's residents are typically locals from the surrounding suburbs, and it typically does not see much of the merchant traffic who typically stay either closer to the docks or on the west bank.
The tavern itself sits on one corner of a 4-way junction.
It is a large, 2-story structure which is attached on one side to what looks to be terraced houses along one of the streets leading up to the junction.
There is a narrow alleyway that runs from the street along the tavern wall, which a window in the tavern's kitchen opens out into.

The door to the tavern opens out into a large hall or common room, a space of approximately 75 square feet.
There is a hearth on the same wall as the entrance doors, and the bar backs onto the wall on the right of the doorway upon entering.
Immediately to the right from the street entrance, on the same wall as the bar, is a small doorway that leads to a staircase and the tavern owner's room.
On the same wall, behind the bar is the entrance to the cellar, and further along the same wall is the doorway to the tavern kitchens.
The cellar leads to the Piranhas' hideout, which is [split into its own location wth a separate map](#mapped-locations).

The bar has a number of stools placed around it for patrons to sit at when ordering.
Various spirits and mixers are placed on shelves behind the bar, and a few casks are setup on the bar itself to draw pints from.
The common area opposite the bar is otherwise filled with tables and chairs of varying sizes.
There is a small area that is kept free and has what looks to be several faded chalk rings drawn on the floor, where fisticuff contests are frequently held.

A staircase on the wall opposite the street entrance leads to a mezzanine level that overlooks the table area and bar, where some more seating can be found and an area is setup for a musician or band to be playing.
Doing a U-turn at the top of the stairs will take a person into a corridor that runs back along the same wall as the staircase, which provides access to the restrooms, guest bedrooms and Hope's room (right at the end of the corridor).

The kitchen - as one might expect - contains a fireplace over which a cooking pot or joint of meat could be places, a number of workspaces with cutting, chopping, and cleaning tools, and a sink and drying rack for crockery.
It also appears to double as where the non-perishable food is stored on the premises, and Whiskers' cat bowls live on the floor of the kitchen too.
Opposite the kitchen entrance is a window that opens up into the alleyway that runs along the tavern wall - there is a puddle of dirty and greasy water underneath the window in the alley, indicating that it is used to dispose of used water.

The owner's room is designed to double as both a bedroom and study - it has a large double bed, floor-to-ceiling wardrobe, and a work-desk with plenty of storage compartments.
There is also a rug laid out across the middle of the room, under which is a loose floorboard that hides a master key to the tavern.
There is a window on the right-hand wall (when entering the room), however it faces out onto the alleyway so doesn't offer much natural light.

### The Piranhas' Hideout

#### Cellar

The door / trapdoor behind the bar at the Day's Rest Tavern descends into the cellar, and from there into Piranhas' hideout.
A staircase leads down one floor / story from the cellar door, into a square room.
There are scones to light the staircase and cellar itself, though by default they are unlit.

On the wall to the left of the stairs are barrels that contain alcohol and other beverages that are sold at the tavern, but also contain some valuable alchemical ingredients / spell components that the Piranhas are storing to pass back to Groubun when he visits.

The wall opposite the staircase is actually hollow, and hides the entrance to the Piranhas' hideout.
This wall is partially obstructed by crates and smaller pallets, and there is the gang mark for hideout / disguise etched into the wall.
There will be splintered wood and scratch marks on the stone floor near the hollow wall.
Inserting one of the gang necklaces into the divot created by this mark opens the hollow wall, providing access to the hideout's [recreation room](#recreation-room).

#### Recreation Room

On the opposite side of the hollow  wall that opens out of [the cellar](#cellar) will be a common or recreation room of sorts.
The room is rectangular, approximately 100ft-by-40ft in floor space.
The hollow wall acts as a doorway that enters through one of the long edges, approximately 10ft away from the nearest wall corner.
There are two doors at the opposite end of the room from this entrance, both doors are again placed on the long walls.
The door on the same wall as the entrance from the cellar is approximately 10ft away from the opposite corner, and leads to the [barracks area](#the-barracks).
The door on the opposite long wall is nestled right in the opposite corner of the "rectangle" that makes up the room - it leads into [the corridor](#the-corridor).

This area is well-lit, contrary to the cellar, and looks like it sees regular use - there will be furniture placed around the room, a small kitchen-like area, and several bookcases and desks.
There will be a desk and bookcase directly opposite the entrance from the cellar, which the gang uses to keep records of sorts.
The centre of the room has creature comforts like a table that will have cards, dice, and other game-related items strewn about it, some rugs and cushions to form a comparatively nice seating area, and a notice board that the gang uses to record information available to all members.
The board in particular includes a [decryption of the gang marks](./scenes/07-infiltrating-the-hideout.md#gang-notice-board) that can be found during the adventure, as well as new additions that have been specifically added to implicate Faire.

The far end of the room includes some kind of food preparation or storage area, and some basic utensils and crockery.

#### The Barracks

The room that the Piranhas use as a barracks or armoury of sorts connects to the [recreation room](#recreation-room), through the doorway on the same long wall as the entrance from the cellar.
This room contains a number of military-like cots, providing basic sleeping facilities, as well as some weapon racks and mannequins that are wearing some patchwork leather armour.

Whiskers' broken cage is also found in this room.
It is a fairly small box, slightly bigger than the box one might use to take cats on public transport or in cars, but is composed entirely of bars with a solid floor rather than having 3 solid walls and a door.

#### The Corridor

Exiting the recreational room via the door in the far corner from the cellar entrance will open into a narrow corridor.
It will be lit by torch scones on both sides, and there will be no visibility issues.
The corridor itself is about 80ft long and wide enough for two people to walk side-by-side.
The two doors at the far end of the corridor lead to [Carlton's HQ](carltons-hq) and [the vault](#the-vault).

The door to Carlton's HQ is relatively unassuming, and does not have any distinguishing markings to indicate it leads into the HQ.

Across from the door to the HQ is the vault door - it has a heavy lock on it, and thick iron bars across it.
The vault door requires two keys to be inserted into it simultaneously to be opened from the corridor - one of these keys is carried by Fordem and Carlton each.

- (Thieves' Tools DC 25) To unlock one of the two vault locks without the required key.
  - On failure: The character attempting to unlock the vault door takes 1d8 lightning damage as the metallic components of the door begin to conduct a harmful electric current. An alarm siren briefly sounds too. Fordem and Carlton will be alerted to the group's presence if they weren't already, and in any event will comment on the futility of opening the vault without the key and invite the party to parley.

#### The Vault

The vault door can be unlocked from the inside by pulling a release lever next to the door.
This will temporarily open the vault door, but it will automatically close and lock after 30 seconds.

The Piranhas' vault is a 20ft-by-40ft room that has minimal decorations.
Several heavy-duty chests will be present inside it, loaded up with valuables, whilst the unsorted good are just scattered about on the floor.
There will be a small horde of valuables in the vault; the party might recognise some of the valuables as those that have gone missing if Shufharz and Kamonas were asked about this.
The majority of these will be packed into wooden crates (currently unsealed) with the lids off and laid beside the crates they fit onto.

There is a small trapdoor in the ceiling, that only opens one-way (from outside into the vault).
The other side connects to the sewer network, any Animated Loot is expected to move through the sewers and then via this trapdoor to get into the vault.

#### Carlton's HQ

Entering Carlton's HQ through the door from [the corridor](#the-corridor) opens into an approximately 45ft-by-30ft rectangular room, with the door on one of the short sides.
The room has several items of taxidermy mounted on plaques on the walls, notably including various types of fish (a piranha among them) and other sea creatures.

Directly across from the doorway, against the far wall is a desk and cushioned chair, that Carlton uses as his planning desk.
To the left of the doorway is a long bench or sofa in an "L" shape, sitting in the corner where the short wall with the door and the (left) long wall join.
A rug is laid out in the surrounding area, and a set of shelves is positioned further along the long wall from where the rug and bench / sofa end.
This set of shelves contains a number of maps with drawings on - seemingly blueprints for various parts of Halfyord's buildings and infrastructure that have been used for planning in the past.
It also contains a number of other documents, like letters from the former (corrupt governor), delivery schedules or reports concerning the movement of merchants through the town, and similar.

At the very end of the left hand long wall is a final door that leads through to Carlton's room.
This room is only about 20ft-by-30ft big, but contains a dense amount of furniture; a double bed, chest, waist-high wardrobe that doubles as a bedside table, and a small weapon rack.

The far wall from the doorway to  Carlton's room bears a faint crack that splits through the brickwork.
Pressing against this crack will cause the section of wall to turn as if on hinges, revealing an entrance into a sewer tunnel.
A small boat with a pair of oars is floating on top of the sewage thoroughfare, moored to a pole.
The thoroughfare, if followed, leads out beyond the city walls into a rather unclean pond.

### Other Locations of Import

Off in the side streets that lead away from the market, on the west side of the Hal, a number of permanent shops can be found.
These include all the usual amenities like a:

- Blacksmith,
- Stables,
- Carpenter,
- General goods store,
- Pawnbroker,
- Jewellers,
- Herbalist,

etc.

## Mapped Locations

Not all scenes in the story have a map provided, which is typically true of the locations where the party's interactions are (expected to be) limited to social interactions or investigations.
Areas of Halfyord that the party visits multiple times, or whose layout is useful to visualise (due to potential combat encounters, or spatial reasoning) are provided here for use.
They have been designed to try and be faithful to the descriptions of the areas given above, and should contain the necessary features that the scenes in the story refer to as holding clues or other sources of information for the party.

All maps give the number of 5ft-by-5ft squares that make up the map, and each map is given to a scale of 50px = one 5ft-by-5ft square.
Click on a location to download its map as either a `.png`.
These maps were made using [DungeonScrawl](https://www.dungeonscrawl.com/), if you want to tweak certain features of the map you can contact the maintainers and we can provide the corresponding `.ds` file.

- [The Great Market Square](./floorplans/market-50px-per-square-36x33.png), 36 (W) by 33 (H) squares. This map is meant to only represent one quarter of the market square, which is why some features abruptly end.
- [The Ordo Magicae Outpost](./floorplans/ordo-outpost-50px-per-square-34x59.png), 34 (W) by (59) squares. The map is divided into the 3 floors of the building, with the ground floor at the bottom of the map and the top floor at the top.
- [The Docks](./floorplans/docks-50px-per-square-75x48.png), 75 (W) by 48 (H) squares. This only represents the relevant docking station and it's connections to the main bridge over Halford. The bridge underpass is provided off to the left of the map as its own small area, since the bridge itself overlaps with the underpass when viewed from above.
- [The Day's Rest Tavern](./floorplans/days-rest-interior_31x33.png), 31 (W) by 33 (H) squares. A trapdoor is used to represent the cellar door entrance, though this could just as well be a regular door depending on the flavour you want to apply.
- [The Piranhas Hideout](./floorplans/hideout-50px-per-square-32x36.png) 32 (W) by (36) squares. The crack in the wall from Calton's room into the sewers is not represented.
