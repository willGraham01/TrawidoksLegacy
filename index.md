## What is this Adventure?

FIXME copied from previous

The Piranhas of Halfyord was initially intended to be an introductory story that would setup a "Western Marches" setting or campaign.
It is a light-hearted adventure that tries to balance simplicity with enough investigative elements to still be interesting, as well as providing a number of "combat" encounters where the objective of the aggressors isn't necessarily to outright kill the defendants.

The adventure tries to balance around a party of 4 level 3 characters, though the focus of the adventure is not intended to be combat.
There should not be many combat scenarios that require in-depth party coordination, though the "dungeon crawl"-esque exploration of the hideout and final confrontation right at the end of the adventure can present a challenge, depending on the party's actions.
A description of Halfyord itself, as well as some backstory for the plot and characters to aid the DM's understanding, can be found in the first three sections ([setting](./setting.md), [background and plot](./background-plot.md), and [characters and factions](./characters.md)).
The story is presented as a series of scenes, the events of which take place in multiple locations in the town of Halfyord, presented in the [scenes section](./scenes.md).
Some notes on customising the adventure to suit your own setting can be found in [customising the adventure](./customising.md).
There are also several appendices with lookups for the custom items the adventure introduces, stat blocks for generic monsters, short NPC summaries for reminders  or quick reference, and some sample player characters for use in the adventure.
