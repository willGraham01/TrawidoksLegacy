title: Halbrook Spring Cave
---

Having initiated the Trawidok rite of passage and passed the test in the clearing, the party arrives at Halbrook spring cave on the backs of the spectral horses.
Here they face another trial that, when completed, will lead them to the woodland spirit's hidden grove.

This scene serves to do the following things:

- Continues the dungeon-oriented portion of the adventure.
- Sets puzzles for the party to complete.

At the end of the scene, the party should hopefully:

- Have unlocked the passage to the Spirit's Grove.

The party can also obtain the following information:

- There is a dead member of one of the Baron's guards / Rolf's band in the cave, whose journal may give the clue that Rolf's band are also on the tail of the woodland spirit.

## Setting

This scene takes place in: Halbrook Spring Cave

If the party arrives on horseback [from the clearing](./05-into-the-woods.md), having started the trials, the spectral horses will ride them to the mouth of the cave, and then disperse into mist.
Otherwise, the party will find the cave either by exploring or by tracking Trohet - in which case the only difference is the manner of the party's arrival.

The cave itself is a somewhat maze-like complex, the floor of which steadily increases in altitude the deeper into the cave the party goes.
The stream that turns into the Halbrook can be seen running through the cave at various points - following the sound of the flow is a hint to the party of the area that they need to reach for the second trial [("leading a horse to water")](#lead-a-horse-to-water).

A sample floorplan of the cave is available for use, but in general the complexity of the cave is up to the DM to decide, and can easily be adapted.
It should however have sufficient space for each of the following "areas" to be included:

- The entrance cavern, where [Trohet](FIXME) will be waiting.
  A fox will be seen chasing a snake into some light shrub when the party arrives, and it will then quickly turn tail when it notices the party.
  The shrubs the snake retreats into contains the [Snake Totem](#trial-of-the-totems).
- A cavern (relatively close to the entrance cavern) where a dead member of Rolf's band / bounty hunter can be found.
- A small den of wolves, where the [Wolf Totem](#trial-of-the-totems) can be found.
- A bear den, where the [Bear Totem](#trial-of-the-totems) can be found.
- A burrow where the [Fox Totem](#trial-of-the-totems) can be found.
- The "end" cavern, where a pool of still water lies and the [Totem puzzle](#trial-of-the-totems) starts.

It is also recommended that you design the floorplan of the cave so that the party stands to come across at least one of the wolf or bear den whilst leading Trohet to the water source at the "end" of the cave.
These areas do not need to be in the direct path and may contain bypasses - however it is important that the party is at least aware of the presence of the other creatures for when they get to the end of the cave and are presented with the Totem puzzle.

## Entering the Cave

When the party decides to enter the cave, they will be presented with the entrance cavern.
This is a fairly spacious and relatively verduous cavern, though the greenery is limited to the entrance cavern since the rest of the cave receives no natural light.
The Halbrook stream can be seen running through the entrance cavern, before it disappears under one of the rock walls.

As the party enters, mention (along with anecdotal scene description) that they see a fox chasing a snake along the cavern floor, with the snake managing to reach some of the shrubs at the cavern entrance.
The fox then breaks off its pursuit of the snake when it sees the party, and flees back into the cave (to the burrow).
The party can investigate the cavern area, or the snake/fox interaction specifically, to potentially find the Snake Totem early.
See the [corresponding section] for the appropriate check.

After the fox and snake scene, allow the party to file into the entrance cavern.
Information that can be gained about the immediate surroundings can be obtained through investigation - allow the players to make appropriate skill checks as per their characters, and select from the information below as befits the roll and action the character is taking:

- The sound of running water can be heard deeper inside the cave, implying that the source of the stream might lie deeper inside the cave.
- There are all manner of creature tracks on the ground in the entrance hall - hoof-prints will be the most obvious, but there are also wolf, bear and fox prints.
  There also appear to be a set of boot-tracks.
  - The party can attempt to follow a set of these tracks, which leads to the corresponding den / burrow of the animal in question.
    Following the boot prints leads to the dead bounty hunter.
- The cavern and immediate exits leading further into the cave appear natural, and are not magical in any way.
  A more thorough investigation may reveal the mural that starts the "lead a horse to water" trial.

### Exploring the Cave

The party is free to explore the cave in advance of engaging with the trials.
All of the totems can be found prior to starting the [Trial of the Totems](#trial-of-the-totems), except for the Horse Totem which is provided by Trohet at the conclusion of the [Lead a Horse to Water](#lead-a-horse-to-water) trial.
Likewise, the mural for the Totem trial is not visible in the "end" cavern until the Trohet has been lead there.

A dead bounty hunter can be found in the cave too.
If any of Rolf's band [were dragged away or left to die at the clearing](./02-on-the-road-again.md), have this be their corpse.
In any event, a torn note or journal entry can be found on the corpse:

- If it is the corpse of a bounty hunter, it is a journal scrap with the following text.
  "Saw the pompous Baron today - in what was the most insufferable interaction I've ever had to endure in my line of work.
  Thankfully the dwarf he seems to depend on - Rolf - seems fairly level headed.
  He's offered to team up and split the reward, and even shared some of his little group's findings with me as a sign of goodwill - sent me to follow some tracks through the woods.

  After hacking through the woods for the best part of the afternoon, I've found this cave.
  There seems to be some kind of plaque - complete with text and everything - in the first cavern.
  Though I can't make heads or tails of the script, I saw hoof-prints leading further into the cave.
  I'm sure I'll find either the horses or the ranchers (or both!) here if I'm careful, then I can return to the Baron for the full reward.
  Rolf clearly means well, but he has a lot to learn about the industry yet."
- If it is the corpse of one of Rolf's band, it is a note written by Rolf with instructions.
  "(Band member name),
  Once we setup in the clearing, I need you to track the damn animals into the woods.
  Keep your distance and be careful - we need you alive to tell us where they're coming from.
  Once you have the location of their den, report back to us at the racecourse, and we'll assemble the team for a complete sweep of the area.
  That'll keep the Baron happy for a few more days, and who knows - we might even get a lead on his precious horses."

## Lead a Horse to Water

After having a look around the entrance cavern, but before the party start venturing into the cave, Trohet will make themselves visible and walk into the entrance hall.
He will walk over to one of the cavern walls and use his head / hoofs to brush away some moss and dirt, revealing a small mural that has the following text engraved into it:

"Lead me, but do not make me;
Guide me, but do not push me."

The text is written in Sylvan.
Characters that speak Celestial can also read the murial in a similar manner to the mechanics of the Comprehend Languages spell - provide the translation but mention that there is some magic helping the character interpret the words as Celestial.
If no party members can read the text, characters with a suitable background, or that speak Elvish, can attempt to identify the language:

- (History DC 10) To identify the text as Elvish.
  - 12+: To recall that Sylvan is the language of the fey.

If the party has Speak with Animals, Trohet will provide a translation, but will not give out additional information for solving the "lead a horse to water" puzzle.
He will also refuse to elaborate on his own nature, the nature of the trials, and the events in Trawidok (at least, for now).
Failing all these eventualities, the party can take a copy of the runes on the mural back to [Hierim](FIXME), who will provide a translation.

The puzzle itself is a play on the idiom "you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink".
The objective is the "end" cavern, where the pool of water and start of the Totem puzzle can be found.

After revealing the mural, Trohet will stand patiently, waiting to be lead by the party through the cave.
He will follow if asked via Speak with Animals, or through suitable animal handling actions (no check is required is suitable action is taken by the party to lead or entice him into moving).
However, an attempt to _forcibly_ move Trohet will have him resist the action, and gallop back to the entrance hall to force the party to "restart" the trial.
Trohet will also refuse to take a route through the cave that passes through the wolf den, or bear den - these treats either have to be bypassed or neutralised.
Getting near to these areas of the cave will make Trohet anxious - the party can make a DC 5 Animal handling check to interpret this behaviour, or a DC 10 Perception check to identify faint animal noises nearby (that are the source of Trohet's anxiety).

Once the party guides Trohet to the "end" cavern with the pool of water, Trohet will move of his own accord to the pool to take a drink.
He will pull the [Horse Totem](#trial-of-the-totems) out of the pool when he is done, and place it in its correct position in the totem slots.
Trohet will then disappear in a cloud of mist that quickly dissipates, returning to the Spirit's Grove.
The mist also serves to draw attention to the mural for the [Trial of the Totems](#trial-of-the-totems).

If the party relied on Speak with Animals to translate the mural in the entrance cavern, have Trohet provide a translation of this mural before he disappears.
If the party tries to ask him where he is going, have him respond with somewhat cryptic answers like "I'll see you there soon enough".

If a character drinks from the pool of water, they gain Speak with Animals for the duration of their time inside the cave (and Spirit's Grove).
The effect ends early if they leave these areas.
Mention that the pool of water has a faint shimmer to it when the party gets close, as if it is giving off some kind of magical essence.

## Trial of the Totems

On the edges of the pool in the "end" cavern is another mural that can be interpreted in the same ways as that in the [entrance cavern](#entering-the-cave).
The text on this mural is

"
The others are bound to the same land as we.
Some lay low, consumed in shadow,
Others stand tall, stretching their necks to see.

All but us live in this sacred cavern,
They all demand your attention if you are to proceed.

The first fears all, The second fears none.
The third eats what it can, Preferably number one.
The fourth fears the second, But only when alone.

Each must be given their place, If you wish to continue on.
"

Above the mural are five circular slots on a flat stone surface.
Four of these slots are in a horizontal line and numbered 1 through 4.
The fifth slot sits centrally above the other 4, and is where Trohet will have placed the Horse Totem he pulled out of the pool.
The other slots look like they would all fit similar-sized totems.

The objective of this puzzle is to collect and place the various totems scattered around the cavern in the correct slots.
Each totem is essentially a small carving of the animal in question, mounted on a circular base.
Each circular base is the same size, so no clues to the correct order can be obtained by looking at the size of the circular slots.

The Horse Totem sits in the fifth slot, which sits centrally above the other four numbered slots.
The other totems are the Bear, Wolf, Snake, and Fox totems, which are scattered throughout the cave.
From first (slot 1) to fourth (slot 4), the correct order / slot for the remaining totems is:

1. [Snake](#snake-totem)
2. [Bear](#bear-totem)
3. [Fox](#fox-totem)
4. [Wolf](#wolf-totem)

Once the totems are placed in the correct slots, mist swirls above the pool and coalesces into a misty portal.
Through the portal, a vibrant, green meadow lined with trees and small bushes can be seen.
This portal leads to the Spirit's Grove, the final trial the party needs to complete, and the final stages of the adventure.

### Finding the Totems

The party may have already acquired some of the totems, however they should at least be aware of the presence of animals within the cave, having just escorted Trohet through it.
If a totem is found and then destroyed / lost / removed from the cave, it reappears in the location it was originally found in.
Any guardians of the totems _also_ reappear in this event!

#### Snake Totem

The Snake Totem can be found in the shrubs near the entrance, where the party first saw a snake fleeing from a fox.
Finding the totem in the grass requires passing a DC 5 Investigation / Nature / Survival check - Druids and Rangers have advantage on this check, as do any other characters with suitable backgrounds.
Alternatively, use of a suitable spell or tool to clear the foliage results in an automatic success.

If the check above is failed, the character must make a DC 10 Dexterity Saving Throw as they provoke the snake in the grass and it bites at them.
They take 1d4 poison damage on a failed save.
After lashing out in this way, the snake transforms into the Snake Totem, which can be picked up without issue.

#### Fox Totem

The Fox Totem is found in the fox's burrow area of the cave.
Arriving at the burrow hole, a character can make one of the following checks to examine it:

- (Nature / Survival DC 5) To identify the burrow as a fox burrow.
  - 10+: To note that it appears to be currently in-use / occupied.
  - 12+: Animal sounds can be heard from inside - the residents are at home in the burrow!
- (Perception DC 12) To hear animal sounds can be heard from inside - the residents are at home in the burrow!
  - 15+ (only with a suitable light source or darkvision): Peering into the burrow, a small statue (the Fox Totem) catches your eye.

The Fox Totem is inside the burrow, but it is too far inside for a character to simply reach for it.
The family of foxes that live inside it are also currently present inside the burrow, and are somewhat protective of the Totem.

One of the foxes can be enticed out with food or another suitable method:

- (Nature DC 10 / Deception DC 15) To entice a fox to poke its head out of the burrow, using a suitable method.
- (Speak with Animals) Offering food or asking if the foxes are home, and speaking into the burrow.

Once a fox emerges, all characters that it can see must make the following check:

- (Animal Handling DC 10) To not frighten the fox back into the burrow.

A non-frightened fox can then be offered extra food, which it will accept.
After taking some, it will let out a small cry into the burrow, and the rest of the family will emerge, looking for more food.
If provided, one of the foxes will then return to the burrow and come back with the Fox Totem in its jaw, which it will relinquish to the party.

The party can instead choose to use a suitable tool (hook on a stick, fishing rod improvisation, mage hand, etc) to remove the Totem from the burrow directly.
In this case, the foxes will attempt hold on to their Totem, but will not pursue out of the burrow if they loose it.

- (Spellcasting DC 10) To wrest the Totem from the burrow if using a spell or other effect.
- (Dexterity DC 14) To get a tool or improvised item into the burrow, and get purchase on the Totem.
  - (Athletics DC 10) To pull the Totem free from the burrow.
    The character pulling the Totem free does not have to be the same character as the one who attempted to get purchase on the Totem.

Finally, a character that can turn into a fox or other suitable animal can enter the burrow in an attempt to retrieve the Totem.

- If the character turns into a fox predator, the family of foxes flees further into the burrow and the Totem can simply be retrieved.
- If the character turns into fox prey, they must succeed on a DC 13 Stealth check to not be noticed by the foxes as they retrieve the Totem.
  Being spotted by the foxes in this way has the two adult foxes attack the shape-shifted party member.
- If the character turns into a fox themselves, they can convince the other foxes to give up the Totem with a DC 15 Persuasion check.
  Alternatively, they can trade food for the Totem as above.

Other solutions may be found by the party - reward innovative solutions.

#### Wolf Totem

The Wolf Totem is in the wolf den, and is guarded by three wolves.
These wolves are guardians of the totem - when they die, their bodies dissipate into mist [like the horses and wolves from the clearing trial](./05-into-the-woods.md).
Once the Wolf Totem leaves the den, and the guardians are no longer actively threatening / aware of the party, the guardians also dissipate.
If the Wolf Totem is destroyed and reappears in the den, so too do the wolves.

The wolves are all awake and patrolling their den, with the Wolf Totem sitting in a small pile of bones and meat scraps at the centre of the wolves' patrol route.
The wolves are trying to establish themselves as the dominant animal inside the cave - though their efforts are hampered by the presence of the [bears](#bear-totem).
They can simply be fought and killed for the Totem, however other methods for retrieving the Totem are possible.

- The wolves can be distracted with meat or other temptations, which will make them leave their patrol routes and head for the source of the distraction.
  The Totem can then be retrieved in their absence, provided the party member(s) are not noticed.
- A character can attempt to sneak passed the patrolling wolves, requiring a DC 20 Stealth check to not be spotted and turn the wolves hostile.
  - A party member shapeshifted into a wolf still needs to make this check, but can resort to dialogue if they are detected.
- If the party has Speak with Animals or another way of communicating with the wolves, they can negotiate to get the wolves to leave the den (and thus, the Totem):
  - If the location of the fox burrow is known, this can be given to the wolves, who will leave to hunt.
  - The wolves cannot be persuaded to give up the Totem for food otherwise.
    If asked what they _would_ exchange the Totem for, they will mention they are trying to kick the bears out of the cave so they can establish their home here.
    They will offer to give the Wolf Totem up if the party can reduce the number of bears in the cave to a maximum of one, which the wolves can then overpower.

#### Bear Totem

The Bear Totem is in the bear den, guarded by three bears.
These bears are guardians of the totem - when they die, their bodies dissipate into mist [like the horses and wolves from the clearing trial](./05-into-the-woods.md).
Once the Bear Totem leaves the den, and the guardians are no longer actively threatening / aware of the party, the guardians also dissipate.
If the Bear Totem is destroyed and reappears in the den, so too do the bears.

The bears are all asleep when the party arrives at the den, with the largest bear sleeping with the Bear Totem underneath one of its paws.
They will be hostile to the party if awoken, or the party are otherwise detected by the bears - there is no reasoning with them.
Waking up one bear does not necessarily wake the others however - if the bear senses easy prey, it may pursue without rousing its comrades.
With suitable planning however, the bears can be lead outside the cave and into the woods, where a character can attempt to throw them off their scent.
If the bears - or any number of the bears - are lead out of the cave in this way, they are treated as if they had "died".

### Next Scenes

After solving the Trial of the Totems, the party can use the portal to travel to [the Spirit's Grove](./07-spirits-grove.md).
