title: Meeting Zanke
---

After being referred to Zanke by one of their other leads, the party heads to her farm to investigate and ask questions about what's going on in Trawidok.

This scene serves to do the following things:

- Provides the information needed to properly start the rite of passage, including the location of the shrine.
- Provides more context about Ginter's execution.

- Zanke, to learn about Ginter
  - More info on the traditionalist / modernist split in the village
  - Info on the RoP if not mentioned yet
  - Will explain the free-roam horse business
  - Opportunity to note the unusual behaviour of Pakane
  - Zanke might mention Trohet and describe her father's horse, that was released before his trial
  - Can obtain the location of the RoP start
  - Can be told that an offering is typically bought to start the RoP

At the end of the scene, the party should hopefully:

- Know where to look to start the rite of passage.
- Know the legend of Trawidok, if they didn't already.

The party can also obtain the following information:

- A description of [Trohet](FIXME), and knowledge that he is [Ginter](FIXME)'s old horse.
- More context about the role of horses in Trawidok's culture.
- Some more information about the rite of passage.

## Setting

This scene takes place in: Dijkstra Farmland

FIXME provide description, then move to setting.

By the time the party arrives at the farm, it will be (at least) midday.
No one will be in the farmhouse, which is locked - the workers and Zanke herself will be out in the fields.
From the farmhouse, the party will be able to see horses drawing ploughs and attached to carts that are being loaded with crops.

## Finding the Person in Charge

When the party rocks up, it will not be clear who is in charge at the farm - unless they have a description of Zanke, they will need to ask or look around.
Access to the grounds is not prohibited, but farm workers will greet the party if they spot them wandering the grounds, to ask them what their business is.
Workers will happily direct the party to Zanke, should they ask.
Otherwise, a character can take a moment to survey the farmland looking for Zanke, or just to survey the scene for more information.

- (Perception DC 13) (ADV: Character has been given a description of Zanke) To pick out Zanke working in the fields.
- If surveying the scene, require one of the following separate checks:
  - (Perception DC 10) There are almost the same number of horses working the fields - or standing to the sides of the fields with saddles on their backs - as there are workers in the fields.
    - 13+: Many of these animals are drawing heavy equipment like ploughs or carts.
    - 15+: Some workers are mounted on horseback, seemingly either reaping crops or collecting produce from horseback.
  - (Animal Handling / Nature DC 10) There are almost the same number of horses working the fields - or standing to the sides of the fields with saddles on their backs - as there are workers in the fields
    - 11+: Many of these animals are drawing heavy equipment like ploughs or carts. They are also seemingly well-domesticated farm animals - none of them appear to object when being asked to take a harness, for example.
    - 13+: The horses that are not in action are not tied to hitching posts. Some are wandering around the fields, but don't appear to be getting in the way of the workers nor do the workers mind that their horses are wandering around.

Zanke will be at the edge of one of the crop fields, having recently dismounted [Pakane](FIXME) to talk to a group of farm workers and take stock of the crops.
Pakane will start to wander towards the enclosure fence when she dismounts, but she will not stop him wandering off.
As the party approaches, they a character may make the same Animal Handling / Nature check as above, but potentially gaining the following additional information:

- (Animal Handling / Nature DC 17) The interplay between Zanke and Pakane, at least that which will have been briefly observed so far, resembles that would typically be observed between a handler and animal that had been working together for many years.
  - 19+: Pakane has wandered off towards the fence that encloses the field, and even though it would be an easy jump over the fence for a horse, Pakane seems to show no signs of intending to do so.
  - 20+: There does not seem to be anything of interest to a horse in the vicinity of the area Pakane has walked / is walking over to. The fence faces out onto the road, but beyond that is just the Trawidok forest.

FIXME the area Pakane has walked across to has Trohet's footprints on the outside.

Once the party approaches Zanke and introduces themselves, and mentions why they're here, she will suggest they speak in the farmhouse.
She will be a tad annoyed to have the working day interrupted, particularly if the party's reason is to ask about Ginter specifically, but nonetheless will be willing to talk to the group.
She will recall Pakane with a whistle, and ride him at a trot back to the farmhouse so the party can follow alongside.
The conversation in the next scene can start on the ride back to the farmhouse, if the party wants.

## The Farmhouse

## Next Steps

Once the party has finished talking to Zanke (and possibly looking around her farm), they may want to pursue any additional leads that they have obtained to this point.

- [Meeting the Baron-Sir](./04a-meeting-the-baron.md)
- [The racecourse grounds](./04b-racecourse-grounds.md)
- [History Lessons](./04d-meeting-zanke.md)

Otherwise, the party may have enough information to [head into the forest](./05-into-the-woods.md) and begin investigating the disappearances, starting at the rite-of-passage site.
In which case, they can proceed to ["into the woods"](./05-into-the-woods.md).

If the party has exhausted all their leads and still does not have a means of getting to the rite-of-passage start point, fire the [fail-safe lead](./04b-racecourse-grounds.md#failsafe-lead-trohet-sighted) when the party leaves.
