## Next Steps

Once the party has finished talking to Zanke (and possibly looking around her farm), they may want to pursue any additional leads that they have obtained to this point.

- [Meeting the Baron-Sir](./04a-meeting-the-baron.md)
- [The racecourse grounds](./04b-racecourse-grounds.md)
- [History Lessons](./04d-meeting-zanke.md)

Otherwise, the party may have enough information to [head into the forest](./05-into-the-woods.md) and begin investigating the disappearances, starting at the rite-of-passage site.
In which case, they can proceed to ["into the woods"](./05-into-the-woods.md).

If the party has exhausted all their leads and still does not have a means of getting to the rite-of-passage start point, fire the [fail-safe lead](./04b-racecourse-grounds.md#failsafe-lead-trohet-sighted) when the party leaves.
