title: Meeting Zanke
---

After being referred to Zanke by one of their other leads, the party heads to her farm to investigate and ask questions about what's going on in Trawidok.

This scene serves to do the following things:

- Provides the information needed to properly start the rite of passage, including the location of the shrine.
- Provides more context about Ginter's execution.

- Zanke, to learn about Ginter
  - More info on the traditionalist / modernist split in the village
  - Info on the RoP if not mentioned yet
  - Will explain the free-roam horse business
  - Opportunity to note the unusual behaviour of Pakane
  - Zanke might mention Trohet and describe her father's horse, that was released before his trial
  - Can obtain the location of the RoP start
  - Can be told that an offering is typically bought to start the RoP

At the end of the scene, the party should hopefully:

- Know where to look to start the rite of passage.
- Know the legend of Trawidok, if they didn't already.

The party can also obtain the following information:

- A description of [Trohet](FIXME), and knowledge that he is [Ginter](FIXME)'s old horse.
- More context about the role of horses in Trawidok's culture.
- Some more information about the rite of passage.

## Setting

This scene takes place in: Dijkstra Farmland

FIXME provide description, then move to setting.

By the time the party arrives at the farm, it will be (at least) midday.
No one will be in the farmhouse, which is locked - the workers and Zanke herself will be out in the fields.
From the farmhouse, the party will be able to see horses drawing ploughs and attached to carts that are being loaded with crops.

## Finding the Person in Charge

When the party rocks up, it will not be clear who is in charge at the farm - unless they have a description of Zanke, they will need to ask or look around.
Access to the grounds is not prohibited, but farm workers will greet the party if they spot them wandering the grounds, to ask them what their business is.
Workers will happily direct the party to Zanke, should they ask.
Otherwise, a character can take a moment to survey the farmland looking for Zanke, or just to survey the scene for more information.

- (Perception DC 13) (ADV: Character has been given a description of Zanke) To pick out Zanke working in the fields.
- If surveying the scene, require one of the following separate checks:
  - (Perception DC 10) There are almost the same number of horses working the fields - or standing to the sides of the fields with saddles on their backs - as there are workers in the fields.
    - 13+: Many of these animals are drawing heavy equipment like ploughs or carts.
    - 15+: Some workers are mounted on horseback, seemingly either reaping crops or collecting produce from horseback.
  - (Animal Handling / Nature DC 10) There are almost the same number of horses working the fields - or standing to the sides of the fields with saddles on their backs - as there are workers in the fields
    - 11+: Many of these animals are drawing heavy equipment like ploughs or carts. They are also seemingly well-domesticated farm animals - none of them appear to object when being asked to take a harness, for example.
    - 13+: The horses that are not in action are not tied to hitching posts. Some are wandering around the fields, but don't appear to be getting in the way of the workers nor do the workers mind that their horses are wandering around.

Zanke will be at the edge of one of the crop fields, having recently dismounted [Pakane](FIXME) to talk to a group of farm workers and take stock of the crops.
Pakane will start to wander towards the enclosure fence when she dismounts, but she will not stop him wandering off.
As the party approaches, they a character may make the same Animal Handling / Nature check as above, but potentially gaining the following additional information:

- (Animal Handling / Nature DC 17) The interplay between Zanke and Pakane, at least that which will have been briefly observed so far, resembles that would typically be observed between a handler and animal that had been working together for many years.
  - 19+: Pakane has wandered off towards the fence that encloses the field, and even though it would be an easy jump over the fence for a horse, Pakane seems to show no signs of intending to do so.
  - 20+: There does not seem to be anything of interest to a horse in the vicinity of the area Pakane has walked / is walking over to. The fence faces out onto the road, but beyond that is just the Trawidok forest.

FIXME the area Pakane has walked across to has Trohet's footprints on the outside.

Once the party approaches Zanke and introduces themselves, and mentions why they're here, she will suggest they speak in the farmhouse.
She will be a tad annoyed to have the working day interrupted, particularly if the party's reason is to ask about Ginter specifically, but nonetheless will be willing to talk to the group.
She will recall Pakane with a whistle, and ride him at a trot back to the farmhouse so the party can follow alongside.
The conversation in the next scene can start on the ride back to the farmhouse, if the party wants.

## The Farmhouse

Zanke will invite the party to take seats in the living space of the farmhouse, but unlike Hierim will not offer drinks or other hospitality.
The layout of the farmhouse is remarkably similar to that of Hierim's dwelling too (and by extension, the party can infer most of the structures here) though Zanke's farmhouse does appear to have an additional, separate space for the kitchen or pantry.
The furnishings in the living room are functional, if not super cosy, however the mantelpiece above the hearth does have some personal or family items on display upon it.
Zanke was also clearly not expecting to host guests, as there are a few items strewn about the room - mostly letters, spare pairs of boots, open books, and what looks to be firewood and other kindling that has yet to be moved into an organised pile.
Where Hierim's residence had (what passed as) the bedroom, Zanke's residence has a staircase leading into a small cellar.
It is used as a storage area, and is where Zanke has stored all her father and mother's personal effects until she has had time to sort through them properly - the records that Ginter had loaned Hierim, and had then been returned, are not present since they are lying in the living room.

The party can look around the living room for conversation topics and other clues about the events in Trawidok.

- (Perception / Investigation DC 10) To notice one of the letters lying around the living room that has not been tidied. The content reads as though the sender has declined a job offer from Zanke, and it is [signed off Teodor](FIXME-stablehands).
  - (Insight DC 10) The letter reads as though Teodor and Zanke are on good terms.
    - 13+: The reasons cited appear to indicate that this "Teodor" wanted more opportunities to travel outside of Trawidok. There is a remark along the lines of "we can't all ride as well as you, so we don't get the delivery jobs".
    This serves as a conversation hook for Zanke's travelling and delivery trips that she would make, back when Ginter was still alive.
    - 15+: Reading further into the text however, it also sounds like there might have been other factors influencing Teodor's decision. There is a small section in the letter that mentions "the Baron is bound to want to expand the racecourse soon, and with me right next door...".
    This is a reference to Teodor's information that he was not necessarily fully willing in the sale of his family's land.
  - 12+: On the mantelpiece are a series of charms. In fact, there are a lot of charms!
    - (History / Religion DC 13) (ADV: A character knows that Ginter was Zanke's father, and was working with Hierim about Trawidok's history) The charms are not necessarily religious, but they are all clear depictions of horses.
      - 15+: They aren't good luck or warding charms, since such charms would be worn on people's persons at all times.
      - 17+: It is likely that they are ceremonial in some way. Perhaps used in a festival or celebration?
      - 19+ (only if the character knows about the Rite of Passage) It would be reasonable to assume that they are used in Trawidok's Rite of Passage.
  - 14+: A character notices a pile of weary-looking books lying on one of the tables. There are 3 or 4 of them, and they are lying in something that resembles a heap. There are other sheets of paper with markings on them amongst the books themselves.
    - These are the records that Zanke had given to Hierim, but has since returned after taking a copy of them. They contain the informal records of births, deaths, inheritances, and (significantly) rite of passage completions and horse names. The larger, loose sheets of paper contain old maps of the village and the surrounding area. The records go back around 400 years, though these are not evenly spaced out in each book and the handwriting style changes multiple times in each book (signifying a change in the village ealdorman). They also don't have a standard way of logging immigration or emigration from the village.
    - (Investigation DC 10 / History DC 13) To identify the records for what they are, though no significant information stands out.
      - 12+/15+: To notice that the last person recorded to have passed the Rite of Passage, according to these records, was Zanke. It also logs her horse's name, Pakane.
      - 13+/16+: To notice that the penultimate person to undertake the Rite of Passage did so 22 years ago.
      - 14+/17+: After flicking back through several pages, a character will also notice that the horses that arrive through the Rite of Passage entries also have corresponding "returned" entries, usually after the person who performed the Rite of Passage passes away. However, deaths within the last 20 or so years appear to not have this matching pattern, nothing is said about the horses that disappeared.
        - If the party has seen the original horse names in the racecourse stables, the character also recognises the names of the horses that have not got their corresponding "released" entry.
      - 16+/18+: A few of the larger sheets of paper appear to be maps. There are no timestamps on these maps, and the scales vary, so it is hard to map the character's knowledge of the layout of Trawidok in the present day to these maps. Cross referencing with the books indicates that the majority of the land in Trawidok has been held by the same families for much of written memory.
      - 18+/20+: One feature that is present on each map is a small trail leading from the southern side of the village into the woods. It is unnamed on all maps barring one, and appears to lead towards the Halbrook. The name given on the one map is "the hunter's trail", which is in reference to the hunting party of the Trawidok legend. The trail leads to the small shrine where the Rite of Passage starts.
  - 16+: The mantelpiece also has what looks to be some sketches that are framed. These are sketches that were done by Zanke's mother, before she died. They are all in black-and-white, using shading to display colour.
    - One sketch has a picture of (a young-ish) looking Ginter, who appears to be smiling whilst on horseback. If asked about this sketch, Zanke will remark that her mother said it was of her father after he completed his Rite of Passage. The horse depicted is Trohet.
      - If the party has already caught a glimpse of Trohet from another lead, a character examining the sketch will notice the distinctive 3-sock marking that Trohet has is mirrored in the sketch.
    - Another sketch is of Zanke, who looks to be around 7-9 years old, grooming the same horse that appears in the first sketch. If asked, Zanke will confirm that it is her looking after Trohet. She'll remark that Ginter used to let her practice riding on Trohet, and how he'd fill her head with stories about his own Rite of Passage and the various legends and other historical events surrounding Trawidok.
    - The final sketch seems to feature Zanke again, around 10-12 years old. She appears to be riding the horse from the other two sketches with her hands in the air, and a huge smile on her face, whilst the horse seems to be moving at speed. The lines on this last sketch are not quite as sharp as the others - there are a few noticeable marks where an eraser has been used to get rid of errors or mistakes, but the style matches the others. If asked about this, Zanke will share that it was the last one her mother made, before dying the following winter from a long-term illness. By that stage, she was already quite frail (hence the errors and eraser marks) and found some joy in looking after a few of the village children, even though she was too unwell to help with labour-work.

### Conversing with Zanke

## Next Steps

Once the party has finished talking to Zanke (and possibly looking around her farm), they may want to pursue any additional leads that they have obtained to this point.

- [Meeting the Baron-Sir](./04a-meeting-the-baron.md)
- [The racecourse grounds](./04b-racecourse-grounds.md)
- [History Lessons](./04d-meeting-zanke.md)

Otherwise, the party may have enough information to [head into the forest](./05-into-the-woods.md) and begin investigating the disappearances, starting at the rite-of-passage site.
In which case, they can proceed to ["into the woods"](./05-into-the-woods.md).

If the party has exhausted all their leads and still does not have a means of getting to the rite-of-passage start point, fire the [fail-safe lead](./04b-racecourse-grounds.md#failsafe-lead-trohet-sighted) when the party leaves.
