title: History Lessons
---

The party visits Hierim in his residence, to learn about the history of Trawidok and the current social tensions the town is caught in the grips of.

This scene serves to do the following things:

- Provides a means for the party to learn about the rite of passage, and some clues that will be needed to solve the puzzles [later on](FIXME).
- Has the potential to provide a [lead for Zanke](./04d-meeting-zanke.md).
- Offers some general insights into Trawidok.

At the end of the scene, the party should hopefully:

- Have heard the legend of Trawidok.
- Have been told about the existence of the rite of passage, but not the details.
- To hear about [Ginter](FIXME)'s execution a few years prior.

The party can also obtain the following information:

- Have heard about [Zanke].
- The basic facts about Ginter's execution.
- Insights into the social tensions currently gripping Trawidok.
- Details on the history of the town.

## Setting

This scene takes place in: Hierim's residence, and possibly the village square if the party asks about local history.

FIXME move to setting!
Hierim's residence is a single-story building that on the outside looks much the same as the other old-village structures.
The inside has slightly nicer furnishings, and a few more creature comforts, than the other houses in the village though.
There is the usual single room that houses the hearth, kitchen, and living area.
The bedroom is separated from the main room by a wooden wall (with an opening rather than a door-frame).
The living area has a large desk set up against one of the walls, which is practically overflowing with papers, books, and correspondence.
Ink blots, empty ink jars, and discarded quills litter the floor and surrounding mantle.

Hierim will be working at his desk when the party arrives at his house.
The shutters will be locked shut, but light can be seen coming from the inside and Hierim will come to the door should the party knock.

## The Scholar

When the party arrives, Hierim will invite them into his house and seat them in the living area.
He will also some herbal tea that he has just finished brewing, should anyone in the party want it.
As the party enters, be sure to mention the desk and the amount of paper scattered around that area, as well as the books that are seemingly lying on every spare table, mantle-shelf and occasional seat.
Hierim is an enthusiastic scholar with nothing ill to hide, though his desk does contain some information that the party might deem relevant that he wouldn't think to share unless prompted.
Likewise his collection of books might be useful for prompting certain lines of conversation.
Insulting Hierim's work or his usefulness will of course make him less inclined to talk to the party and share information.

A character can attempt to examine the books that are lying around or in view should they wish:

- (Investigation / History 12) These texts are all non-fiction, and mostly contain (the fantasy equivalent of) census records and land deeds. Their content is not dissimilar ot that of [the Doomsday Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesday_Book) from medieval history.
  - 14+: There are a few texts, however, on folk-tales, myths, and legends. Without reading over these books, it is difficult to ascertain what they contain.

Characters can also attempt to look through Hierim's desk for information, or at least for topics to raise with him in conversation.
Hierim will let a character who asks look through his desk notes, though he will request that they try not to move things too out of place - though the desk is already in a state of "organised" mess.
Depending on what a character is looking for, or which skill they choose to employ whilst looking through the desk, different information can be gathered:

- (Insight / Investigation / History / Religion DC 10) Hierim's desk contains a mixture of what seems to be notes and correspondence with other scholars, local villagers, and the nobility.
  - Insight 10+: From his correspondence and personal logs, Hierim seems genuinely excited to be here researching Trawidok's history.
    - 11+: It seems Hierim is most interested in local history and folklore, and less so the administrative branch of his work concerning census information.
    - 13+: There are a large stack of papers, which seems to be correspondence between Hierim and [someone called "Ginter"](FIXME). The tone of these messages seems to resemble that of work colleagues who later became friends independent of their work.
    - 15+: One of the pages towards the back of this stack is not from Ginter, as can be identified from the handwriting style. It addresses Hierim by name, and mentions that Ginter would have wanted Hierim to have his almanac and records. It is signed off as ["Zanke"](../characters/zanke-dijkstra.md).
    - 17+: The tone of this last letter implies that Ginter must have passed away. There is an odd clause towards the end of the letter, mentioning "the Baron didn't see fit to confiscate anything else of his" at a similar point in the letter to where the almanac and records are mentioned.
  - Investigation 10+: From his correspondence, Hierim seems to be here in the employ of the earl.
    - 11+: Though most of what Hierim is reporting back to the earl is historical information, the earl's responses focus heavily on requests about the ownership of the land.
    - 13+: In particular, these letters seem to mention the land the racecourse is built on, numerous times. They also make reference to Trawidok's population and harvest output of recent years.
    - 15+: From examining the line of questioning in multiple letters, it sounds like the earl is concerned that Trawidok is "in decline". Hierim's responses all indicate that harvest output is down, and the original population is emigrating or coming under the employ of the [Baron-Sir](../characters/caius-equirrion-younger.md) - whose racecourse keeps expanding.
    - 17+: It seems that the earl's concern is both because as Trawidok declines, the Baron-Sir becomes more influential in terms of land and prestige (thanks to his growing racecourse) at the earl's expense (in terms of tithes and taxable population).
  - History / Religion 10+: Hierim seems to be gathering a mixture of factual records (census data, harvest yields, land rights), as well as collating the local history and customs into written record.
    - 11+: One such work makes reference to the statue in the village square, and the regiment that was founded here.
    - 13+: This note makes particular mention of the unusual armour decorations, and the fact that it was a cavalry regiment originally - typically militia regiments tended to be infantry due to the time and money required to train suitable horses (and riders).
    - 15+: Another note by Hierim references that the villagers seem to have an affinity for working with horses, and treat them with a great deal of respect. He also notes that the villagers do not breed their horses, but instead seem to source them from the wilds around Halfyord.
    - 17+: Further notes reveal the rite of passage tradition the village has had for as many years as in living memory. There is a note Hierim has written to himself that says "find time to ask Zanke about hers".

Finally, a perceptive character may notice that Hierim's house faces out onto the village square, potentially giving them something else to ask him about:

- (Perception DC 13) The living area window seems to look out over the village square. Hierim has hung what looks to be an architectural sketch of the village square's statue a frame next to this window, as if for the purpose of comparison.

If Hierim met the party in the Horsewhistle the previous evening, once everyone is seated he will introduce himself and give a short overview of his work and reason for being in Trawidok.
At this point he will also mention that the party are free to look at the books and notes that are lying around.
He will start a conversation in one of the following ways:

- If the party was predominantly interested in the social tensions currently gripping Trawidok back in the Horsewhistle, he will start there.
- If the party was predominantly interested in the history or customs of Trawidok back in the Horswhistle, he will start with an overview of his work and a summary.
- If the party did not encounter Hierim in the Horsewhistle the night before, he will ask the party what the nature of their visit is. Based on their response, he will start the conversation with the appropriate topic above.

For ease of organisation, Hierim's topics of conversation have been organised in subsections below.
However depending on the flow of the conversation, topics might bleed into one another.
Furthermore, Hierim knows more information than he will think is relevant to the party - though he will not hold such information back if asked about it, unless the party goes out of their way to annoy or insult him.
This information that Hierim does not think is relevant is marked with `[*]` in the topics below - the party may need to investigate his books and notes to get him to talk about this, or bring in information from other leads they have already investigated.

### Ancient History

### Recent History and Social Troubles

### Customs and Folklore

## Next Steps

Once the party has finished conversing wth Hierim, they may want to pursue any additional leads that they have obtained to this point.

If they have not yet visited Zanke, and has missed all prior opportunities to hear about her, have Hierim make a request of the party as they're leaving.
He will ask them to take Ginter's almanac and records back to Zanke, asking that the party tell her that he has taken a copy of each for study, and so is returning the originals.
The party can ask him for more information about the almanac and records if they have not done so already.

- [Meeting the Baron-Sir](./04a-meeting-the-baron.md)
- [The racecourse grounds](./04b-racecourse-grounds.md)
- [Meeting Zanke](./04d-meeting-zanke.md)

Otherwise, the party may have enough information to [head into the forest](./05-into-the-woods.md) and begin investigating the disappearances, starting at the rite-of-passage site.
In which case, they can proceed to ["into the woods"](./05-into-the-woods.md).

If the party has exhausted all their leads and still does not have a means of getting to the rite-of-passage start point, fire the [fail-safe lead](./04b-racecourse-grounds.md#FIXME) when the party leaves.
