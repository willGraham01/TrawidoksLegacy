title: Arrival in Trawidok
---

The party travels with Rolf's band to Trawidok, reaching the town late in the evening.
They will need to find a place to board for the evening, and will be offered an audience with the Baron-Sir in the morning.

This scene serves to do the following things:

- Gets the party safely to Trawidok.
- Allows the party some time to plan for the next day.
- Allows the party to form some first impressions of the town.

At the end of the scene, the party should hopefully:

- Have a lead for at least two of the 'sources of information', discussed below.

The party can also obtain the following information:

- The layout and geography of Trawidok.
- Further leads on the sources of information, below.

## Setting

This scene takes place on the road from the clearing in [scene 2](./02-on-the-road-again.md) to Trawidok, and then within Trawidok itself.

See the [setting](../setting.md) page for a description of the locations the party will visit.

## Leaving the Clearing

Following the events in [the clearing](./02-on-the-road-again.md#combat-encounter), Rolf will want to take his band back to Trawidok to resupply and inform the Baron-Sir of what happened.
He will suggest that the party travel with his group, in case there are further dangers along the road.
If the party joins Rolf and his group along the road, the journey will be uneventful.
This offers another chance to talk to Rolf and his band, potentially even trying to befriend them or squeeze additional information out of the group about Trawidok or the Baron-Sir himself.
Rolf will enquire about why the party is heading to Trawidok if they have not told his band already.
In any event, it will be approaching nightfall when the group reaches Trawidok - Rolf will offer to introduce the party to the Baron-Sir in the morning, if the party has told him of their intentions to work the bounty.
Rolf will see it as a gesture of goodwill following the events in the clearing.
Even if the party don't outright tell him they're planning to ask about the bounty, Rolf will still suspect (from their appearance or skills displayed in the clearing) their intentions, and offer to introduce them to the Baron-Sir.

Note that if the party chooses to stick around and investigate the clearing, Rolf will not hang around and will begin to prepare his band for travel.
If they leave without the party, Rolf will tell the party to ask for him at the racecourse when they reach Trawidok as he would otherwise do when the group reaches Trawidok (above).

## Arrival in Trawidok

Once the party arrives in Trawidok and begins walking through the more urbanised main streets, have each member of the party make one of the following checks (of their choice):

- (Animal Handling DC 10) Many of the domesticated farm animals that the party has passed appear not to have locked sties, stables, or coops. Though there are wider enclosures to keep the animals penned in, it seems that the animals are afforded free roam of these areas.
  - 13+: In particular, there appears to be a large concentration of farm horses in Trawidok, based on the farms that were passed. A typical farm might have one or two shire horses at best, but there are far more horses per farm here.
- (History DC 10) To recognise the regiment of the figure in the [main square's statue](../setting.md#the-village-square). It appears Trawidok was the town from which the regiment was raised originally.
  - 13+: The regiment depicted has since dropped most of its formal ties to Trawidok, and now forms part of the regular army rather than a militia-level local regiment. Still, the statue mentions the pivotal role the original regiment had before it was incorporated into the standing army.
- (Insight DC 10) Locals in the streets seem to be wearing worn but sturdy farmhand clothes, and are likely peasants or lower-class merchants.
  - 13+: The local people in the street seem to be giving Rolf's band a wide berth. A character also notices occasional side-glances followed by rapidly-increased pace when a peasant makes eye contact with Rolf's band.
  - 15+: A similar behaviour is noted towards the party, with the difference that it seems to be curiosity in the locals' faces rather than acute fear.
- (Perception DC 10) A character notices that several of the bounty posters (similar to the one Paige was asked to deliver) are posted on boards and public buildings. Some of these have small groups of locals gathered around them, involved in conversation.
  - 13+: These groups of locals don't seem to be discussing the bounty poster itself. It is difficult to make out anything useful from their conversations without the full context, however.
  - 15+: Though the conversations cannot be followed, it generally sounds like people's opinions of the fact that the Baron-Sir's bounty is still unclaimed ranges from indifference to slight happiness / approval.

Rolf and his band will part ways with the party once the group reaches the main square.
Rolf will inform the party that his band is being quartered at the racecourse boarding house, which is not generally open to the public.
Given the day's events, he will mention that he expects tomorrow to be a recovery day, and so the party should have no difficultly asking for him by name once the racecourse opens tomorrow.
Rolf will recommend the party look for boarding and dinner at [The Horsewhistle](../setting.md#the-horsewhistle), and mention that there aren't really any other places to look for accommodation in town.
