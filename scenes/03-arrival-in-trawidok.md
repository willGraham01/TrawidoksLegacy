title: Arrival in Trawidok
---

The party travels with Rolf's band to Trawidok, reaching the town late in the evening.
They will need to find a place to board for the evening, and will be offered an audience with the Baron-Sir in the morning.

This scene serves to do the following things:

- Gets the party safely to Trawidok.
- Allows the party some time to plan for the next day.
- Allows the party to form some first impressions of the town.

At the end of the scene, the party should hopefully:

- Have a lead for at least two of the 'sources of information', discussed below.

The party can also obtain the following information:

- The layout and geography of Trawidok.
- Further leads on the sources of information, below.

## Setting

This scene takes place on the road from the clearing in [scene 2](./02-on-the-road-again.md) to Trawidok, and then within Trawidok itself.

See the [setting](../setting.md) page for a description of the locations the party will visit.

## Leaving the Clearing

Following the events in [the clearing](./02-on-the-road-again.md#combat-encounter), Rolf will want to take his band back to Trawidok to resupply and inform the Baron-Sir of what happened.
He will suggest that the party travel with his group, in case there are further dangers along the road.
If the party joins Rolf and his group along the road, the journey will be uneventful.
This offers another chance to talk to Rolf and his band, potentially even trying to befriend them or squeeze additional information out of the group about Trawidok or the [Baron-Sir](../characters/caius-equirrion-younger.md) himself.
Rolf will enquire about why the party is heading to Trawidok if they have not told his band already.
In any event, it will be approaching nightfall when the group reaches Trawidok - Rolf will offer to introduce the party to the Baron-Sir in the morning, if the party has told him of their intentions to work the bounty.
Rolf will see it as a gesture of goodwill following the events in the clearing.
Even if the party don't outright tell him they're planning to ask about the bounty, Rolf will still suspect (from their appearance or skills displayed in the clearing) their intentions, and offer to introduce them to the Baron-Sir.

Note that if the party chooses to stick around and investigate the clearing, Rolf will not hang around and will begin to prepare his band for travel.
If they leave without the party, Rolf will tell the party to ask for him at the racecourse when they reach Trawidok as he would otherwise do when the group reaches Trawidok (above).

## Arrival in Trawidok

Once the party arrives in Trawidok and begins walking through the more urbanised main streets, have each member of the party make one of the following checks (of their choice):

- (Animal Handling DC 10) Many of the domesticated farm animals that the party has passed appear not to have locked sties, stables, or coops. Though there are wider enclosures to keep the animals penned in, it seems that the animals are afforded free roam of these areas.
  - 13+: In particular, there appears to be a large concentration of farm horses in Trawidok, based on the farms that were passed. A typical farm might have one or two shire horses at best, but there are far more horses per farm here.
- (History DC 10) To recognise the regiment of the figure in the [main square's statue](../setting.md#the-village-square). It appears Trawidok was the town from which the regiment was raised originally.
  - 13+: The regiment depicted has since dropped most of its formal ties to Trawidok, and now forms part of the regular army rather than a militia-level local regiment. Still, the statue mentions the pivotal role the original regiment had before it was incorporated into the standing army.
- (Insight DC 10) Locals in the streets seem to be wearing worn but sturdy farmhand clothes, and are likely peasants or lower-class merchants.
  - 13+: The local people in the street seem to be giving Rolf's band a wide berth. A character also notices occasional side-glances followed by rapidly-increased pace when a peasant makes eye contact with Rolf's band.
  - 15+: A similar behaviour is noted towards the party, with the difference that it seems to be curiosity in the locals' faces rather than acute fear.
- (Perception DC 10) A character notices that several of the bounty posters (similar to the one Paige was asked to deliver) are posted on boards and public buildings. Some of these have small groups of locals gathered around them, involved in conversation.
  - 13+: These groups of locals don't seem to be discussing the bounty poster itself. It is difficult to make out anything useful from their conversations without the full context, however.
  - 15+: Though the conversations cannot be followed, it generally sounds like people's opinions of the fact that the Baron-Sir's bounty is still unclaimed ranges from indifference to slight happiness / approval.

Rolf and his band will part ways with the party once the group reaches the main square.
Rolf will inform the party that his band is being quartered at the racecourse boarding house, which is not generally open to the public.
Given the day's events, he will mention that he expects tomorrow to be a recovery day, and so the party should have no difficultly asking for him by name once the racecourse opens tomorrow.
Rolf will recommend the party look for boarding and dinner at [The Horsewhistle](../setting.md#the-horsewhistle), and mention that there aren't really any other places to look for accommodation in town.

## The Horsewhistle

Hierim Lempicki - is more "neutral" and the village chronicler. will direct to Zanke about the RoP in recent times though.

If the party heads to the Horsewhistle to look for accommodation for the evening, they will arrive to find the inn relatively busy, but nothing like the taverns in Halfyord.
The Horsewhistle is clearly the village's local pub first, and any kind of bed & board serves a secondary purpose.
[Malon Daxidor](FIXME) will be behind the bar, in conversation with some of the local patrons, including Hierim.
Others will be sat at tables or entertaining themselves with games of ring-throw / molkke, darts, and cards.
The patrons at the inn all come from either the neutral or traditionalist villager faction (though the party may not be aware of such divisions within the village yet), though [Zanke Dijkstra](../characters/zanke-dijkstra.md) will not be present.

The party's entrance will garner notice from some of the patrons, mostly because this is a small village and the party are outsiders.
Malon will also notice the party's entry and greet them from behind the bar, to get their attention.
They will have enough free bunks for the party to stay, and will throw in a complementary evening meal & invite them to partake in some of the tavern games if they so choose.

[Hierim](FIXME) will attempt to enquire about the party's business for being in Trawidok.
If the party reveals that they are here for the Baron-Sir's bounty, Hierim will give them a word of advice about what the locals think about the Baron-Sir, his racecourse, and his employees.
Hierim will also warn the party that others in the village might not take kindly to the party upon hearing this information, so will advise them to keep the information to themselves.
The party can request more information from Hierim, who will be able to give them leads on some of Trawidok's history (both ancient and more recent) and an overview of the divisions currently hanging over the village.
If the party wants more information about the ancient history of Trawidok, Hierim will invite them to meet him tomorrow one he's "gotten over the beers" he's drunk this evening.
This should hopefully provide the party with a second lead to follow up the following day.

The party can attempt to get more information from the other patrons in the inn, who are further entrenched in the traditionalist faction than Hierim.
These patrons can be persuaded through dialogue to share their opinions of:

- The Baron-Sir, potentially giving a lead about [Ginter Dijkstra](FIXME).
- The younger generation opting to move away from farming.
- The loss of tradition, potentially giving a lead to the rite of passage and Zanke.
- The rite of passage, as above.
- Recent events in Trawidok (pertaining to the horse disappearances, which have been limited to the race-course).

Players will need to role-play appropriately to get an opportunity to obtain such information at this stage, and the DM may decide to require checks rather than simply providing the information.
There will also be a bounty poster pinned to the wall near the door, that a character looking around the tavern might spot.

- (Perception DC 14) To spot the bounty poster near the door, which appears to have been defaced slightly.
  - Upon closer examination, a character will notice that the poster has been vandalised in an unflattering way for the Baron-Sir. Phrases such as "profiteer", "corrupt", and even as strong as "murderer" (in reference to Ginter a few years back) can be seen written across the text.
  - Malon or Hierim can be asked about the poster, can also provide some of the leads above.

Once the party is done for the evening, allow a long rest and for the story to resume in the morning, the next day.
Before the party heads to sleep, it may be worthwhile prompting them to come up with an initial plan of action for the coming day.

## The Morning and Following up Leads

Once the morning arrives, allow the party to take breakfast in the Horsewhistle before heading out for the day's activities.
From here, each of the possible "leads" that the party might already have - or come to acquire during the day - lead to their own scenes, and so have been organised into "sub-scenes" in the list below.
There is nothing to stop the party from tackling the scenes out of order, or splitting up to cover more ground if they feel it is worthwhile.
Although the Baron-Sir will - in the meeting with him - insist time is of the essence, in reality there are no "time-locked" events in the story.
There is a fail-safe lead though, should the party need additional assistance due to the culmination of a series of poor dice rolls or investigative skills.

The possible leads are:

- [An audience with the Baron-Sir](./04a-meeting-the-baron.md), which is the lead Rolf should have offered to the party.
- [Investigating the racecourse grounds](./04b-racecourse-grounds.md) and talking to the staff.
- [Visiting Hierim](./04c-history-lessons.md) to learn more about Trawidok's history.
- [Seeking out Zanke](./04d-meeting-zanke.md) to discuss either her father, the rite of passage, or the divisions within the village.
- Watching the farmlands for suspicious activity, potentially sighting Trohet. This also doubles as the "if all else fails" lead. See FIXME:section-of-4b for more details.

## Next Scenes

The party is now free to pursue any additional leads that they have obtained to this point.
The adventure is setup in such a way that they _should_ be inclined to head to either the racecourse to meet Baron-Sir Caius, or possibly to Hierim's home ot learn about Trawidok's history.
There is no "correct order" for the party to follow the leads in, and some information has redundancies in other sub-scenes, so complete exhaustion of ideas is not necessary:

- [Meeting Baron-Sir Caius](./04a-meeting-the-baron.md), the lead that Rolf should have provided.
- [Investigating the racecourse grounds](./04b-racecourse-grounds.md), a lead the party will get once they speak to the Baron-Sir.
- [History lessons](./04c-history-lessons.md), Hierim's invitation to the party if he gave it at the bar.
- [Meeting Zanke](./04d-meeting-zanke.md), a lead that the party can acquire from the other scenes, or possibly from certain actions at the inn during the evening.

Once the party has gathered enough information, they should want to head into the forest to investigate further.
This ends the scene and marks the beginning of ["into the woods"](./05-into-the-woods.md).
