title: The Racecourse Grounds
---

Having spoken to Baron-Sir Caius, and gained his permission to look around the racecourse grounds, the party can continue their investigation and hunt for the horse-ranchers.

This scene serves to do the following things:

- Drops the information that the horse disappearances might not be because of ranchers.
- Allows for other leads to be obtained by the party.
- Serves as the "emergency lead" in the event the party fails to gather enough information.

At the end of the scene, the party should hopefully:

- Have conversed with [Teodor](FIXME), gaining information about the thefts, rite of passage, and situation in Trawidok.
- Had the opportunity to examine the stables and behaviour of the stabled horses.
- Had the opportunity to snoop around the racecourse grounds, looking for further information.

The party can also obtain the following information:

- They might catch [Trohet](FIXME) scouting the racecourse, or find evidence of a horse walking on the outside of the perimeter fence.
- Notice the difference in behaviour between the Trawidok-native horses (which tend to be in a group) and the non-native horses.
- Discover that only Trawidok-native horses have gone missing.
- Gain insights into why the village populace is divided, and why many resent the Baron-Sir.
- Gain insights into how the Baron-Sir has been running and expanding the racecourse, to an extent at the expense of the village.

## Setting

This scene takes place in: The Trawidok Racecourse Grounds.

The party will be given access to the racecourse grounds by [Baron-Sir Caius](../characters/caius-equirrion-younger.md) after [conversing with him](../scenes/04a-meeting-the-baron.md#meet-the-baron) in his office.
This is not a prerequisite for looking around the racecourse - the party can pretend to be potential clients, or elect to sneak around the racecourse without permission if they so choose.
However, such approaches will have consequences later on if the party is discovered, though if [Rolf](../characters/rolf-timberfell.md) is on side he might be able to stop the situation getting out of hand.

FIXME move to setting description.
The racecourse grounds can be accessed by exiting the concourse building on the ground floor, at the end of the building opposite to the reception / lobby area.
The upper story of the concourse serves as a viewing area where (presumably) food and drinks are served during racing events, with a large glass window looking over at the racecourse tracks.

The racecourse tracks form several potential racing routes, which each share common portions of the track.
The start and finish are located in clear view of the concourse gallery, and natural obstacles such as trees or thickets have been removed to make the majority of the track visible from the gallery with the aid of binoculars or telescopes.
Low picket-style fences run along each side of the tracks, which are wide enough for around 7 horses at their thickest - in places like the start and home straight - to barely more than finger paths in other places.
Some tracks have hurdles laid out about them, and swing-gates are present at track junctions to allow for course alterations between races.
The grounds themselves are ringed by a wooden picket fence that is approximately head height - this fence has no gates to provide entry, though the stables has exits that come out both inside and outside the grounds.

The stables complex is a large, single-story building that is flanked by the perimeter fence.
It has an exit that leads out onto the racecourse grounds; first into a fairly large holding pen that contains a water and feed trough, then through another gate that gives access to the tracks.
Another exit from the main building opens up outside the grounds to allow for transfer of horses into / out of the stables.
There is also a smaller-sized door on one side of the building that is clearly access for racecourse staff.
Inside the building are a number of paddocks for horses - some with wooden name labels - stocks of hay and water troughs, and a tool shed that the stablehands have access to.
The paddocks have shuttered windows, but those that face out into Trawidok are locked shut for the time being.

When the party arrives, Teodor will be working in the stables along with another stable-hand.
A further stablehand will be out in the racecourse grounds maintaining the track and reinforcing the damaged portion of the fence.
All the (remaining) racecourse horses will either be in their paddocks (non-Trawidok-native horses) or in the holding pen (Trawidok-native horses).
Trohet will be in the vicinity of the holding pen. FIXME:draw yourself a map, Will!

## Conversing with the Stablehands

When the party exits onto the grounds, have either Teodor or the other farmhand be organising the feed for the Trawidok-native horses in the holding pen notice the party and call out to them in a friendly but inquisitive tone ("can I help you?" or similar).
The party can be upfront in their motivations adn explain they're here on the bounty, or attempt to fudge an excuse should they choose.
Teodor and the other stable hands will be less inclined to speak ill of the Baron-Sir if they know the party are bounty hunters, but will be less inclined to talk about how the racecourse operates and the horses that are stabled if they don't know the party has the Baron-Sir's blessing.
This can be combatted with suitable role-playing during conversation, allowing one of the situational checks below;

- (Persuasion / Deception / Intimidation DC 14) To convince Teodor and / or the other stablehands to talk openly about the information they would otherwise keep to themselves (either about how the Baron-Sir treats his employees or the details of the horses, as above).
  - Other types of check may be appropriate here, in which case the same effect can be garnered but through different means.
  - A performance check might be applicable if the party is sporting the line that they are jockeys or representatives of the nobles.
  - Likewise, an Animal Handling check might be appropriate if the party is claiming to be new hires or vets, or similar.

Otherwise, the party can get information from Teodor (and the other stablehands) that they are willing to share.
This information is given on [Teodor's character summary](FIXME), however a summary of the important information Teodor (or any of the other stablehands) can provide is below.
The party can also return to Teodor to ask further questions, if they find anything during their investigations of the racecourse grounds.
Entries that start with `[*]` indicates information that will only be given if Teodor knows the party is with the Baron-Sir, and `[^]` indicates information that will only be given if Teodor believes the party is not working for the Baron-Sir.

- The native-Trawidok horses are the ones out in the holding pen currently.
  - These horses appear to be more sociable, at least with each other.
    - If questioned about the [hoof-prints on the outside of the holding pen](#the-holding-pen), Teodor will mention that wild horses still roam the nearby woods, and given the sociable nature of the Trawidok horses (at least between themselves) it is not uncommon for horses to approach the racecourse perimeter when the stablehands are not in the immediate area.
    - Teodor will offhandedly mention that he has caught a glimpse of one particular horse that has been coming to the perimeter fence quite often - he wll give a less-than-detailed description of [Trohet](FIXME) if asked to describe it.
  - They also enjoy being outside more than their counterparts, getting restless and anxious if held inside for even short periods of time. Getting them in for the evening is a nightmare.
    - Teodor thinks this is the reason why only Trawidok-native horses have gone missing - they are much more "wild" than their non-native counterparts who happily reside in the stables.
  - `[*]` Most of the Trawidok horses were purchased from locals such as Teodor himself when their parents passed away.
    - Such horses were then sold on to the noble friends of the Baron-Sir as race-horses, given the natural hardiness and strength of Trawidok horses.
      - `[^]` If asked about the [tally in the tool shed](#the-stable-interior) and the horse names that do not appear on the paddocks, Teodor will inform the party that those were the original names of the Trawidok-native horses, before they were sold.
    - If asked where the locals get their horses from originally, Hierim's name will be mentioned. Teodor will offhandedly mention that the "traditionalists" still believe in the old rite of passage, but that he doesn't know the details of it. He will mention that [Zanke](../characters/zanke-dijkstra.md) was the last person to undergo the rite, however.
    - Horses were traditionally released back into the woods when their owners pass away.
  - `[^]` Teodor came into the Baron-Sir's employ partly because he didn't want to be a farmer, but also because there had been ramping pressure on his family to sell their farmland to the Baron-Sir, to accommodate an expansion to the racecourse.
    - This has happened to a number of smaller farming families, whose descendants have now moved out of the area. The population of Trawidok has been steadily declining through this affect.
    - As far as Teodor is concerned, the work is fine, and the opportunities to travel are greater - the Baron-Sir needs someone who knows a thing or two about horses to be present at court when he is approached by a potential buyer!
- `[*]` The Baron-Sir's list of buyers has dried up recently.
  - Again, this will be blamed on the horse ranching.
- If asked whether they have any suspects for the ranchers, the stablehands will say they do not.
  - `[^]` The stablehands will mention that this is not the first time there have been problems with horses disappearing from the racecourse. If pressed for more details, they will simply mention that there was an attempted break-out nearly 5 years ago, and Zanke's father was the perpetrator. They will suggest the party talk to her for more details.
  - If asked about Rolf and his band, Teodor will explain they have been in the employ of the Baron-Sir for some time now. They're not likely to be suspects, since they have a steady pay from the Baron-Sir.
    - `[^]` Teodor will qualify "for some time now" with "since the break-out incident". This may lead to the thread above.
- If asked about the nature of the break-outs, Teodor will point out the portion of the fence currently under repair, and provide some details:
  - It was during a race-day event, in the presence of several nobles. `[*]` The Baron-Sir was hosting one of his usual social events.
  - During the last lap, the leading 4 horses turned the penultimate track corner and picked up speed , as would be expected. But as they approached the final corner, where the track runs very close to the perimeter fence, the heads of the horses seemed to turn towards the woods, as if something had caught their attention.
  - The 4 horses then suddenly bucked and threw off their jockeys. This naturally caused pandemonium for the racers behind the leading group.
  - The now riderless horses then charged straight at the perimeter fence. There was a portion of the fence that had been weak for some time and needing replacement, but which was still tall enough to prevent a jump.
  - But the horses simply charged through the weak spot in the fence, seemingly unbothered by the force of impact, and tore off into the woods.
  - Naturally the Baron-Sir arranged for the fence to be repaired rapidly, and had the stable-hands patch over the new hole with a temporary picket fence (only half the height of the rest of the fence). However the following day, as the horses were being lead out for morning feeding, another horse bolted over the holding pen fence, beelining straight for the weakened portion of the perimeter fence, and was gone before anyone could catch it.
  - `[*]` The Baron-Sir now has one of Rolf's band posted at the hole in the fence at all times, and has arranged for an artisan from the city to come and rework the perimeter fence into a stone wall.

## The Stables and Holding Pen

The Trawidok-native horses will be out in the holding pen, though under close watch from a member of Rolf's band.
The other horses will be inside the stables.

### The Stable Interior

A quick inspection of the interior of the stables will not reveal anything that looks out of place; the water and food looks normal, the paddocks are a decent size (if a bit small), and the building is well-maintained.

- (Investigation / Animal Handling DC 12) It occurs to a character that the stables have an exit that opens out into one of the main Trawidok roads. If someone wanted to steal the horses, it would be much easier (and safer, by virtue of avoiding the woods) to break the horses out into the main road, then lead them away from the town.

Looking into the tool shed will again not reveal anything out of place, though a character might notice that the stablehands are keeping an informal tally of victories for each horse at the races.

- (Investigation / Perception DC 13) To notice the victory tally that is being kept. Each horse's name is carved into the wood, and underneath is a tally of their race victories.
  - 14+: Some of the horse names appear on the paddocks, but there are some names that do not match those on the paddocks.
  - 15+: All of the paddocks for which the horse names match those on the tally are currently stabling a horse.
  - 16+: The victory count for the mismatched horse names greatly exceeds those of the matching names - in fact, the horses whose names match only have around 5 wins total between them.

This information might make the party suspect some kind of fraud or inside job.
However if the party goes back to Teodor to ask about the tally, or already knows that only Trawidok-native horses have gone missing and these horses were purchased from the locals *and then* sold to the nobles, they may piece together that the names used in the tally are the original horse names before the nobles renamed them.

### The Holding Pen

Teodor and the other stablehands will not be willing to open the gate (exiting onto the track) for the party to enter the holding pen, though they will mention that the party can get access by going through the stable building or just by climbing over the fence.
Characters investigating the inside or outside of the holding pen for clues may notice hoof-prints on the *outside* of the fence that the holding pen shares with the perimeter fence.

- (Investigation / Survival DC 13) To notice a large collection of hoof-prints on the outside of the perimeter fence that is shared with the holding pen. There is no discernable trail to follow, as the prints are lost in the long grass that grows not far from the perimeter fence.
  - (Survival 15+ / Animal Handling DC 12 / Perception DC 14) To notice that the Trawidok horses in the pen are all grouped up together near this perimeter wall, and switch between interacting with each other and looking out of the pen towards the surrounding woods.

If a character enters the holding pen, they will find that the feed and water troughs are well stocked and have not been tampered with or drugged in any way.
If they attempt to approach the group of horses near the fence however, have them roll an Animal Handling check:

- (Animal Handling DC 15) As the character gets within around 15ft of the group of horses, one-by-one they will turn to face the character(s). If the characters attempt to get any closer, the group will begin shifting away from the approaching players. If it is unable to do so, it will *stampede* the party as described below.
  - On fail: Teodor will call out to the character(s) attempting to approach the group, to notify them that the horses appear to be getting anxious at their approach. Indeed, the horses will now be focused on the approaching character(s), and rocking their heads and stamping their front hoofs into the ground.
  - If the character(s) still attempt to approach:
    - (Animal Handling DC 20) To get the same result as if the first check was passed.
    - On fail: the Trawidok horses run at the approaching character(s) in a *stampede*, and will settle on the far side of the holding pen, where they will calm down. Characters caught in the stampede must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15) or take 2d4+2 bludgeoning damage, and be knocked prone. Characters that save take half the damage.

## The Broken Fence

If the party has not heard about the breach in the perimeter fences where the first 4 horses escaped, identifying the breach via inspecting the grounds requires either a Perception or Investigation check:

- (Perception / Investigation DC 11) To notice one of Rolf's band standing next to a section of the perimeter fence, that looks worse for wear.

Otherwise, the party can simply walk over the the spot in the fence that Teodor pointed out.
A member of Rolf's band will be at the breach, looking very bored.
If any of Rolf's band survived [the encounter in the clearing](../scenes/02-on-the-road-again.md#combat-encounter), the guard will recognise the party as they approach.
The guard doesn't know a lot about why they are guarding the section of perimeter fence, other than the obvious "it's a bit broken".
They will have heard through word-of-mouth that this is where the horses originally got free, but can't provide any more information than what Teodor may have already told the party.

The area can be investigated by the party.
A character looking for signs of sabotage or looking to assess the damage to the wall can make one of the following checks.
The checks do not have to be done in the particular order they are given in

- (Athletics DC 12 / Acrobatics) Leaning, pushing, or trying to balance on the fence posts will make them lean outwards, sinking slightly into the ground and making creaking sounds (due to the weak backs of the fence posts).
  - The guard will make a joke along the lines of "try not to destroy the fence while I'm on duty" once this happens.
  - The following Investigation or Nature check has advantage if the character performing the check knows about this weakness in the fence.
- (Investigation / Nature DC 14) To notice that the turf on the outside of the section of breached fence has been dug up - the backs of the fence posts are exposed further down than their fronts.
  - 15+: The backs of the fence posts have also seemingly been struck by a heavy, blunt object. Splits in the wood can be seen running down the base of the fences.
  - (Investigation 19+): A character with this knowledge has advantage on the following Survival or Nature check to spot and follow the tracks.
  - (Nature 16+) To discover the tracks, as per the information that can be gained from the following Nature check(s).
- (Survival / Nature DC 16) There are several sets of hoof-prints on the outside of the perimeter fence, presumably left by the escaped horses.
  - 17+: One set of these tracks is older than the others, and is directed towards the perimeter fence rather than away.
  - 18+ (only if the character has been told that 4 horses were in the initial escape): There are 5 sets of hoof prints on the other side of the fence, all leading into the woods.

If the party becomes aware of the tracks leading away from the perimeter fence, they can follow them easily enough until they reach the woods to the south.
From here, the party must make the following check to be able to continue following the tracks:

- (Survival DC 13) To follow the tracks into the woods.

The tracks will lead to the rite of passage offering shrine, where they will be lost.
The party might have enough information to proceed to [Into the Woods](./05-into-the-woods.md) - otherwise, use the ["arriving too early"](FIXME) guidance in that scene.

## Failsafe Lead: Trohet Sighted

If the party has exhausted all their leads and has yet to find the rite of passage offering site, or suspect that it is not people who are responsible for the horse disappearances, fire this event.
Otherwise, this event should be skipped.

After returning from their final lead, have the party catch sight of Trohet running from the edge of the village (or the perimeter fence if the party is at the racecourse) into the woods.
Have some member(s) of Rolf's band - on foot - be seen futilely chasing after Trohet and shouting for help in catching him.

Trohet will leave fresh tracks that the party can follow, but these will be lost when the party reaches the rite of passage site.

## Next Steps

If the party followed the tracks into the woods and does not yet have enough information to proceed to Into the Woods, or failed to find the tracks and still has other leads, they can pursue those:

- [Meeting the Baron](./04a-meeting-the-baron.md)
- [History lessons](./04c-history-lessons.md)
- [Meeting Zanke](./04d-meeting-zanke.md)

Otherwise, the party may have enough information to [head into the forest](./05-into-the-woods.md) and begin investigating the disappearances, starting at the rite-of-passage site.
In which case, they can proceed to ["into the woods"](./05-into-the-woods.md).

If the party has exhausted all their leads and still does not have a means of getting to the rite-of-passage start point, fire the fail-safe lead when the party leaves.
