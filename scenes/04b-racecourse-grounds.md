title: The Racecourse Grounds
---

Having spoken to Baron-Sir Caius, and gained his permission to look around the racecourse grounds, the party can continue their investigation and hunt for the horse-ranchers.

This scene serves to do the following things:

- Drops the information that the horse disappearances might not be because of ranchers.
- Allows for other leads to be obtained by the party.
- Serves as the "emergency lead" in the event the party fails to gather enough information.

At the end of the scene, the party should hopefully:

- Have conversed with [Teodor](FIXME), gaining information about the thefts, rite of passage, and situation in Trawidok.
- Had the opportunity to examine the stables and behaviour of the stabled horses.
- Had the opportunity to snoop around the racecourse grounds, looking for further information.

The party can also obtain the following information:

- They might catch [Trohet](FIXME) scouting the racecourse, or find evidence of a horse walking on the outside of the perimeter fence.
- Notice the difference in behaviour between the Trawidok-native horses (which tend to be in a group) and the non-native horses.
- Discover that only Trawidok-native horses have gone missing.
- Gain insights into why the village populace is divided, and why many resent the Baron-Sir.
- Gain insights into how the Baron-Sir has been running and expanding the racecourse, to an extent at the expense of the village.

## Setting

This scene takes place in: The Trawidok Racecourse Grounds.

The party will be given access to the racecourse grounds by [Baron-Sir Caius](../characters/caius-equirrion-younger.md) after [conversing with him](../scenes/04a-meeting-the-baron.md#meet-the-baron) in his office.
This is not a prerequisite for looking around the racecourse - the party can pretend to be potential clients, or elect to sneak around the racecourse without permission if they so choose.
However, such approaches will have consequences later on if the party is discovered, though if [Rolf](../characters/rolf-timberfell.md) is on side he might be able to stop the situation getting out of hand.

FIXME move to setting description.
The racecourse grounds can be accessed by exiting the concourse building on the ground floor, at the end of the building opposite to the reception / lobby area.
The upper story of the concourse serves as a viewing area where (presumably) food and drinks are served during racing events, with a large glass window looking over at the racecourse tracks.

The racecourse tracks form several potential racing routes, which each share common portions of the track.
The start and finish are located in clear view of the concourse gallery, and natural obstacles such as trees or thickets have been removed to make the majority of the track visible from the gallery with the aid of binoculars or telescopes.
Low picket-style fences run along each side of the tracks, which are wide enough for around 7 horses at their thickest - in places like the start and home straight - to barely more than finger paths in other places.
Some tracks have hurdles laid out about them, and swing-gates are present at track junctions to allow for course alterations between races.
The grounds themselves are ringed by a wooden picket fence that is approximately head height - this fence has no gates to provide entry, though the stables has exits that come out both inside and outside the grounds.

The stables complex is a large, single-story building that is flanked by the perimeter fence.
It has an exit that leads out onto the racecourse grounds; first into a fairly large holding pen that contains a water and feed trough, then through another gate that gives access to the tracks.
Another exit from the main building opens up outside the grounds to allow for transfer of horses into / out of the stables.
There is also a smaller-sized door on one side of the building that is clearly access for racecourse staff.
Inside the building are a number of paddocks for horses - some with wooden name labels - stocks of hay and water troughs, and a tool shed that the stablehands have access to.
The paddocks have shuttered windows, but those that face out into Trawidok are locked shut for the time being.

When the party arrives, Teodor will be working in the stables along with another stable-hand.
A further stablehand will be out in the racecourse grounds maintaining the track.
All the (remaining) racecourse horses will either be in their paddocks (non-Trawidok-native horses) or in the holding pen (Trawidok-native horses).
Trohet will be in the vicinity of the holding pen. FIXME:draw yourself a map, Will!
