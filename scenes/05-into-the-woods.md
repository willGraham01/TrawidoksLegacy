title: Into the Woods
---

The party heads into the woods, either in pursuit of Trohet, or planning to undertake the Rite of Passage.

This scene serves to do the following things:

- Sets up the "dungeon crawl" portion of the adventure.
- Sets the stage for the grand reveal at the end of the adventure, and rewards investigation done prior.

At the end of the scene, the party should hopefully:

- Reach the Halbrook Spring cave.

The party can also obtain the following information:

- Not directly, but they will be able to infer that Trohet, and by extension other Trawidok horses, are not mundane animals.

## Setting

This scene takes place in: The woods to the south of Trawidok.

The party will likely enter the woods following a trail left behind by Trohet, or using directions for the clearing with the shrine given to them by Zanke.
The former will be a trail through unbroken wood - there will be a small, uneven passage marked by (intermittent) patches of hoof-prints to allow the party to keep teh general direction.
The directions given by Zanke will lead the party along a hidden, but otherwise clear and well-trodden, path - wide enough for a single person or horse to travel along it.

Both trails exit into a small clearing on the northern bank of the Halbrook.
The shrine is a modest stone altar with wooden carvings and other small offerings like fruit, vegetables, and crafted charms (similar to the [ones in Zanke](./04d-meeting-zanke.md#the-farmhouse)'s house).
There is a small, raised stone plinth in the centre of the altar which is barren.
The clearing is actually the clearing that is referenced in the [Legend of Trawidok](FIXME), where the hunters encountered the horses and wolves - this forms the basis of the first test that the party will undergo.

## Arriving at the Clearing

The journey to the clearing will be uneventful.
If the party is following the directions given by Zanke, they will arrive into the clearing directly opposite the Halbrook's bank, facing the shrine.
Otherwise, the trail left by Trohet will place them into the clearing on the north-west edge.
Describe the clearing - being sure to mention the altar, though reserve some details for when the party does a closer inspection.

## Starting the Trial

The party will need to start the trial by placing a charm they received from Zanke onto the small, raised plinth on the altar.
If they do not have a charm, they can "cheat" by using some of the items that are already present at the shrine, or by placing their hands on the altar and making an appeal to the [woodland spirit](FIXME).

- (Nature DC 15) To successfully make an appeal to the woodland spirit to begin the trial without a charm or offering.

The party has a maximum 3 chances to start the trial - once with a charm, another with a suitable offering, and another through beseeching the woodland spirit.
Failing on their first attempt(s) at the [clearing's trial](#clearing-trial) has no negative repercussions beyond possibly draining party resources.
Failing the final attempt results in the party failing the adventure - in this case, they will have nothing to show for their actions and their investigation leads will go cold.
See [possible endings](FIXME-baron is removed but another noble replaces him) for Trawidok's outlook and the party's reward.

## Clearing Trial

The clearing trial is - as Zanke will have warned the party - a test as to whether the party respects the legend of Trawidok.
If the party has read and remembers the legend, they should be able to figure out what the trial is requiring of them.
However if they have read the legend, and fail their first attempt, allow all party members to do a check to "remember" the legend:

- (History DC 10) To recall the meeting between the hunters, horses, and wolves in the legend of Trawidok.
- (Nature DC 11) To notice that this clearing bears resemblance to the clearing described in the legend of Trawidok, where the hunters came across the horses cornered by wolves.

Once a suitable offering or appeal has been made at the shrine, the following things happen:

- The light from outside the clearing seems to dim, and it becomes almost impossible to see through the trees into the woods beyond the clearing. Even in the middle of the day and right up against the edges of the clearing, it is impossible to see more than 5ft into the woods. Characters are not prevented from leaving the clearing - in which case they will discover that they cannot _see back into_ the clearing once they move into the woods.
- Spectral forms will emerge from the Halbrook and morph into horses. They will group up at the banks of the Halbrook, facing away from the river as if watching something approach.
- Shortly after the horses emerge, another set of spectral forms will move out of the woods and take the shapes of wolves. They will form a circle that backs the horses against the Halbrook, but which leaves a gap for the party to run through to reach the horses.

### Objective of the Trial

The trial requires the party to re-enact the scene from the legend of Trawidok when the hunters came across a herd of horses trapped by some wolves, and rode them to safety.

The players are not required to kill any of the wolves to "complete" the trial, simply mounting the horses will suffice.
Once all the spectral horses are mounted, they will set off into the woods with the party on their backs, riding to [the Halbrook Spring cave](./06-halbrook-spring-cave.md).

If the party kills a few of the wolves (as is done in the legend by the hunters originally) have more spectral wolves emerge from the woods to replace them - this does not constitute a failure so long as the party then mounts the horses.
Killing one "wave" of wolves buys an additional combat round for the party to mount the horses (see [running the trial](#running-the-trial)).

However, if the party attempts to kill the replacements, all the spectral wolves and horses will vanish, and the trial is considered a failure - the party must mount the horses and allow them to take them to "safety".

### Running the Trial

There should be as many spectral horses as there are party members.
The number of spectral wolves is not important - they have no intention of damaging the players, so have successful hits against them result in automatic deaths.

The trial itself should be run like a combat encounter - have the party roll initiative alongside the horses and the wolves.
On their turns, the horses will shuffle in retreat, bunching up together as the wolves - on their turn - tighten their circle.
The wolves will pay no attention to the party's actions (though will still approach mounted horses if not all party members are mounted up).

After 3 combat rounds, if any party members are not mounted on horses, the wolves pounce onto the horses and the party has failed the trial - the spectral forms disappear when the wolves touch the horses.
If all party members are mounted on horses, then at the end of that round the horses take off into the woods towards the Halbrook Spring cave, and the trial has been passed.

## Next Scenes

If the party completes the trial successfully, they will be carried by the spectral horses to the [Halbrook Spring cave](./06-halbrook-spring-cave.md), where they will continue the trials.

If the party failed the trial, they will have to return to Trawidok in failure.
Consult the [possible endings](FIXME) page for a guide on what to do.

Note that if the party fails their first attempt, they may choose to return to Trawidok to gather more clues before trying again.
This is perfectly fine (and advised if the party genuinely doesn't have enough information!) - in which case, they may go "back" to any of the previous scenes:

- [Meeting Baron-Sir Caius](./04a-meeting-the-baron.md), the lead that Rolf should have provided.
- [Investigating the racecourse grounds](./04b-racecourse-grounds.md), a lead the party will get once they speak to the Baron-Sir.
- [History lessons](./04c-history-lessons.md), Hierim's invitation to the party if he gave it at the bar.
- [Meeting Zanke](./04d-meeting-zanke.md), a lead that the party can acquire from the other scenes, or possibly from certain actions at the inn during the evening.
