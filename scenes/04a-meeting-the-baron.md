title: Meeting the Baron
---

The party heads to the Trawidok racecourse to meet the [Baron-Sir](../characters/caius-equirrion-younger.md) and discuss the bounty he has put out.

This scene serves to do the following things:

- Introduces Baron-Sir Caius Equirrion (the Younger) to the party.
- Drops hints at the source of social tensions in Trawidok, and related leads.
- Grant permission to investigate the racecourse and grounds, and speak to the staff.

At the end of the scene, the party should hopefully:

- Know Caius' motivations for putting out the bounty.
- Understand the social pressures Caius is under from the nobility, and the social divisions he has sown in Trawidok.

The party can also obtain the following information:

- Can hear mention of Ginter's failed heist a few years ago.
- Learn that only Trawidok-native horses have been taken / gone missing.
- Hear about the RoP last being performed by Zanke from the stable-hands.
- Can learn more about Rolf & his band's role in the town and as employees of the Baron-Sir.

## Setting

This scene takes place in: The Trawidok racecourse.

The racecourse has a reception area that serves as the boarding house reception, and leads into the racecourse concourse.
Both the lobby and the boarding house will be accommodating nobles who have some stake in the racecourse - either patrons of events or owners of horses stabled there - though they will not be busy spaces.
Rolf and some members of his group will be in the lobby acting as a security detail.
The Baron-Sir will be in his office, currently in a meeting with FIXME:important-noble who is demanding either action or compensation for his missing horse.
If the party arrives later in the day, rather than first thing in the morning, there will be more nobles accosting the Baron-Sir when the party gets an audience.

## Rocking up at the Racecourse

When the party arrives at the racecourse, the lobby receptionist will call over to them, to get their attention and for them to state their business / reason for their visit.
If the party mentions they are here for an audience with the Baron-Sir, the receptionist will respond unenthusiastically and say that the Baron-Sir is in important meetings all day, and the party will have to wait in the lobby if they want a slot today.
The party can also ask the receptionist some basic questions about the history of the racecourse, what events the racecourse hosts (which will be none in the immediate future) and who the racecourse employs.

If Rolf extended an invitation to the party, he will overhear the party's conversation with the receptionist and approach after the party is told they'll have to wait for an audience.
He will greet them warmly, and after initial greetings and remarks, offer to lead them to the Baron directly.
Rolf will lead the party into the lobby, where the party has the chance to overhear some of the conversations between the nobles - have each member of the party make a Perception check as they pass through the lobby.

- (Perception DC 10) A character can overhear some of the conversations the noble-looking figures are having. These conversations seem to have shifted in focus, with the party being the subjects. Most of the phrases that can be caught are along the lines of "must be extra hired help", "maybe the Baron needs more help than he's letting on", or "clearly the Baron hasn't got the situation in hand if more help is needed".
  - 13+: Some conversations have not changed topic, and are discussing the animosity of the traditionalist villager faction towards the nobles that frequent the racecourse. Phrases like "those peasants are so ungrateful, none of them would provide hay for my carriage horses" or "one of the peasants had the nerve to ignore my commands earlier" can be picked out.
  - 16+: One conversation between nobles concerns the temporary closure of the racecourse and the loss of horses owned by the conversing nobles. Phrases such as "if Caius cannot find my horse, he best be prepared to compensate me" and "Caius won't be able to hold out for long, the failings of his enterprise are already becoming a scandal at court".

The nobility will not be inclined to talk to the party about these issues without a lot of social charm from the party.
Rolf will simply ignore the conversations, but if asked about the mood of the nobility will offer some surface-level insights (essentially nothing more than what was obtained from the above checks).
Eventually, Rolf will lead them through a door to a staircase, heading to the upper level above the concourse.
From there, he will head to the Baron-Sir's office and pause outside the doors.

## Meet the Baron

Outside the double-doors to the Baron-Sir's office will be another couple of members of security, who will recognise Rolf.
They will mention that the Baron-Sir is currently meeting FIXME:important-noble, but from what they can hear on the other side of the doors it "doesn't seem to be going well".
Rolf will offer to introduce the party, and will mention the correct way to address the Baron-Sir to avoid drawing his ire.
Before entering the office, and after the two guards mention that the Baron-Sir's current meeting isn't going well, the party (or characters therein) can make another Perception check (DC 16), a success affords the information from [the 16+ bullet point in the prior check](#rocking-up-at-the-racecourse) (and only the 16+ information).

When the party is ready, Rolf will push open the double doors and enter the Baron-Sir's office.
FIXME:important-noble will briefly pause in his complaints to the Baron-Sir to turn and see who has interrupted the meeting.
If it is later than the morning, other nobles will also be present in the office, all talking over each other.
The Baron-Sir will have to raise his voice and address Rolf as he enters, which will broker a silence in the room.
During the following conversation, FIXME:important-noble (and other nobles if it is later than morning) will make comments on and frequent interjections into the conversation that occurs between the Baron-Sir and the party.
Baron-Sir Caius will attempt to have the other nobles clear the room, but they will insist on staying so that the Baron-Sir does not attempt to keep them out after he's finished talking to the party.

The Baron-Sir will give the party a very formal overview of the situation - or rather, his take on the situation.
He will provide the following facts;

- At least 6 horses have gone missing in the past few weeks. FIXME:important-noble will interject to highlight that one of these horses was his prize thoroughbred, a horse that he purchased from FIXME:stablehand after they inherited the horse from their late parents. _This_ piece of information serves as a hook to bring to the party's attention that only Trawidok horses are going missing.
- The Baron will mention that a number of bounty hunters have been through since the bounty was put up. Besides Rolf's band, the Baron-Sir has not seen them come back since. He does not know where they went, though Rolf will hypothesise that - if they wandered into the woods - they met a less fortunate fate than what happened to the party [in the clearing](../scenes/02-on-the-road-again.md#combat-encounter).
- After raising a couple of points, one of the nobles present will angrily remark that the Baron-Sir appears to be lacking tangible leads. Caius will angrily respond that the nobles aren't forthcoming with their help, and are "about as much use as the peasants, and they aren't exactly enamoured with us".
  - (Persuasion DC 10) To get the Baron-Sir to elaborate on his comment. He will mention that one faction of the village is hostile to the presence of the racecourse, and label the villagers as ungrateful for his work bringing notability to the town.
    - 13+: Caius will go on to say an offhand comment about how the traditionalist faction are too "caught up in their past" and unable to move on. The younger generation are slowly coming round to the idea that working for the Baron-Sir at the racecourse is preferable to toiling in the fields all day.
    - 15+: After Caius as finished talking about the above points, a disgruntled noble will make an offhand comment about how Caius has mis-managed the racecourse since taking over from his father. Caius will ignore this remark.
    - 16+: The disgruntled noble will also mention that "the Baron did not endear himself to the village when this last happened", referring to Ginter's heist and execution years ago. The Baron will again respond with an offhand comment that the peasant "got what was coming to him", and won't offer to elaborate on the situation beyond brief details.
  - (Insight DC 10) To determine that there is some meaning behind the noble's choice of words that would carry more weight, but the character is lacking the context to infer this meaning.
- Caius will conclude the meeting by giving the party free roam of the grounds, and encourage them to speak to his stablehands who know more about the "situation on the ground" than he does. If the party has no questions, the Baron-Sir will then dismiss them, and Rolf will follow the party out of the office too.

Whilst the Baron-Sir is talking, party members who are not actively engaged in the conversation can attempt to inconspicuously look around the office.
Have such party members make one of the following checks, of their choice:

- (Investigation DC 10 / Perception DC 11) To notice a large portrait hung behind the Baron-Sir's desk, which appears to be of the Baron-Sir and an elder gentlemen of some resemblance - possibly an uncle or father. They appear to be standing in the racecourse grounds, with the concourse building in the background, however the area does not appear as built up as it does today.
  - Investigation 12+ / Perception 13+: To notice a land charter framed on the wall to the side of the portrait. The words are difficult to make out, but it appears to reference "Baron Caius Equirrion the Elder".
  - Investigation 14+ / Perception 15+: A few clauses of the charter can be made out after applying a small amount of focus. It appears that the land was inherited from a distant relative, though it mentions that a sizeable sum was paid to ensure the inheritance of the land. This might imply the inheritance was not necessarily the "usual" method of inheritance. FIXME: this refers to the fact that the late Baron purchased the land from a distant relative upon the death of their immediate family in Trawidok.
- (Stealth DC 11) Moving around the (somewhat crowded) office slowly and without drawing attention, a character will come across a ledger that has been left open on a side desk. It appears to contain business transactions.
  - 15+: The ledger can be swiped without anyone in the room noticing. This allows the following investigation checks to be undertaken at any time, by another member of the party if so desired.
  - (Investigation DC 8) The ledger contains records of the horses that are stabled at the racecourse. The missing horses are also marked as such.
    - 10+: All the horses that are missing have, in their respective entries, that they are native to Trawidok.
    - 12+: Some employee records in the ledger, including that for FIXME:stablehand, mention the fact that Caius purchased the employee's land and farm animals as part of the employment arrangement.
    - 14+: There is also an entry in the ledger from around 4.5 years ago that refers to [Ginter's horse](FIXME) as "never recovered", along with giving a description of the animal. Some notes in the entry mention that the horse was released prior to Ginter's sentencing and therefore the next of kin (Zanke) is not liable for compensation. _This serves as a potential lead for getting information from Zanke_.
- (Persuasion DC 10) To ingratiate oneself with one of the nobles present in the office, in whispered conversation whilst the main conversation is taking place. Such a noble will be willing to talk about:
  - Their missing horse. They will provide a description of their horse, and mention that it is a native Trawidok breed. They purchased it from the Baron-Sir's stock, but don't know the details of how he acquires or breeds the horses themselves.
  - They will also mention (if prompted) that the Baron-Sir is an active member of the noble court, and his ability to hold events at the racecourse and have other nobles maintain a stake in its continued running
  - 13+: They will also mention that the racecourse being closed temporarily is framing the Baron-Sir in bad light in court. The Baron also stands to loose a small fortune in compensation if he cannot recover the property the nobles have lost (their horses).
  - If asked about what would happen if the Baron-Sir defaults, the noble will remark that it is most likely that the land would be sold back to the peasants who are now in the Baron-Sir's employ.
  - 15+: The noble will also remark that the Baron-Sir is far more ambitious than his late father. The recent expansions to the racecourse in order to hold grander, and more frequent events, are evidence of this ambition.

## Next Steps

Once the meeting is over, Rolf will take his leave of the party, cracking a joke along the lines of "good luck on the job, but not too much - wouldn't want you beating me to the prize after all!".
The party is now free to pursue any additional leads that they have obtained to this point, the geographically closest being the racecourse grounds.

- FIXME link to other simultaneous leads

Otherwise, the party may have enough information to head into the forest and begin investigating the disappearances, starting at the rite-of-passage site.
In which case, they can proceed to FIXME:next-actual-scene.

If the party has exhausted all their leads and still does not have a means of getting to the rite-of-passage start point, fire the fail-safe lead when the party leaves.
