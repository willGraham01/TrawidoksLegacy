title: Setting Off
---

The party hears word of Paige Fleetfoot's experience travelling to Halfyord, and the wider problems that Trawidok seems to be facing.

This scene serves to do the following things:

- Gives the party their lead and some basic information about the adventure.
- Serves to provide a way to "gather" the party if they do not know each other.

At the end of the scene, the party should hopefully:

- Have set out for Trawidok.
- Have heard about the [incident on the road](FIXME paige horse flee thing) the previous day.

The party can also obtain the following information:

- Basic information about Trawidok, and its notable characters.

## Setting

**NOTE** If you are not playing this scene after the events of The Piranhas of Halfyord, see the [customising the adventure](FIXME) section for ideas on how to adapt this scene.

This scene takes place in: Halfyord, The Day's Rest Tavern.

The tavern may or may not have been remodelled by the party and/or Hope following their acquisition of the premises.
It will be between mid-morning and lunch when the scene begins.

## Party Introductions

If necessary, have the party introduce (or re-introduce) their characters, and allow some time for role-playing interactions.
The DM can prompt players to comment on what their character might be doing with their downtime in the tavern, or how they have been spending the time between this adventure and the closing stages of The Piranhas of Halfyord.
Hope - the caretaker NPC if she was kept on - can also be used to prompt conversations with the party.
Whiskers - if the party never discovered his true identity - will also be present at the tavern as usual.

## Work Offer

Once any introductions and role-playing conversations are concluded, have there be a knock at the tavern door.
Hope will answer the door if no party member does.

At the door will be [Paige Fleetfoot](../characters/paige-fleetfoot.md), alongside Captain Shufharz and a couple of town guards.
Their horses will be hitched to a post in the street.
Shufharz' disposition towards whoever answers the door (and the party in general) will play into how she interacts with the party in this scene, but in terms of the adventure it is ultimately superfluous and does not lock out any information.

After being invited in and initial greetings, Shufharz will introduce Paige and invite them to explain the reason for this visit.
Paige will then go on to explain the events of the last few days, encompassing their trip from Trawidok to Halfyord.
They will also mention their occupation as a courier, if the party is curious about the reason for their visit.
Paige will recount the following information:

- They arrived in Trawidok 3 days ago, along with the marchant caravan they were travelling alongside.
  - Paige will comment that travelling in groups tends to make the roads safer, even though the roads around Halfyord are usually pretty safe.
  - If asked about the others in the caravan, they will mention that the people who made up the caravan went their separate ways upon reaching Halfyord. Some of the merchants went straight to the docks for an onward journey, others are staying in the area for a while, etc.
  - Paige will mention that a couple of the wagon horses were too tired to continue the journey, so the caravan made the decision to swap them out at a local stables.
    - This "swapping out" of horses was a common practice at way-stations when horses were the primary means of transport. Rather than having to wait days for a horse to recover, a travelling group would stop at a way-station and trade out their tired horse for a fresh one, to continue the journey tomorrow.
  - However, they found that most of the villagers needed their horses to work their farms and land, and wouldn't trade-out (even when offered compensation for doing so). This lead the caravan to enquire at the local race-course.
    - The stable-hand at the race-course seemed hesitant to trade as well, and ended up calling down the race-course owner from his office to negotiate directly (Paige felt this was rather odd).
    - Although initially reluctant to trade-out, after the merchants in the caravan sweetened the pot, the race-course owner agreed to loan some of his horses for the journey to Halfyord. But he also insisted that the caravan take some guards, who would return the loaned horses from Halfyord once the journey was complete. He also gave Paige a copy of his [bounty letter](FIXME) to pass on to the authorities in Halfyord.
- After spending the night at the local inn in Trawidok, the caravan set off towards Halfyord.
  - The caravan guards were amicable if not exactly friendly, but overall the caravan felt a lot safer with them present - even if some were wondering why the race-course owner would send them along.
  - After a day's travel, the caravan made camp in a large clearing not too far off the main road, about 3/4 of a day out from Halfyord.
    - In the middle of that night, the camp awoke to the sounds of wolves and other wild animals. Panic engulfed the camp as the animals starting running through it, looking for food and frightening the draft animals.
    - In the panic, the two horses loaned from the race-course broke their leashes and fled into the woods. In the chaos, no-one was able to chase them down.
    - The guards from the race-course eventually managed to restore order in the camp, using torches to scare off the animals that had invaded.
    - In the aftermath, it appeared no-one had been seriously injured. Some of the food stored on one of the wagons had been spilt and lost, and the remaining draft animals were spooked. The caravan members lit torches around the perimeter of their camp for the remainder of the evening. The only "big losses" appeared to be the two horses loaned from the race-course.
- The morning after the attack on the camp, the guards from the race-course announced they had to report what had happened back to their employer, and so departed from the caravan to return to Trawidok.
  - The remainder of the caravan made it to Halfyord by the end of the day.
    - Missing two horses, progress was slower than anticipated, but outriders from the Halfyord guard eventually came across the group shortly before sundown, and helped the caravan make it into the city before nightfall.

Paige (or Shufharz) will then mention that they took this issue to Governor Kamonas, along with the bounty letter that Paige was supposed to pass on.
Although Trawidok is not within Halfyord's jurisdiction, Halfyord imports most of its food from the area and Kamonas knows that Baron-Sir Caius, the race-course owner, carries a lot of weight at court.
As such, they recommended Paige seek out the party, with this offer of work.

## Preparations

After recounting this information, Paige will stick around to answer any questions that the party has.
Shufharz can also help with some logistical information about getting to Trawidok; the journey usually takes around 2 days for a riding party of a small band of adventurers who are travelling light.
Paige will also suggest that - if the party is planning to take up the bounty - they look out for the campsite where the caravan was attacked on the way, and will provide some landmarks for reference, so the party knows when to head off the path to find the clearing.
It will likely be around noon by the time Paige has recounted the story, meaning that there is only half a day's travel time remaining before darkness sets in.
Shufharz and Paige will both recommend the party heads out at first light tomorrow, andPaige will comment that the campsite should be safe so long as the party sets up torches and takes shifts keeping watch (which seemed to keep the animals at bay after the initial attack).

The party might want to undertake some preparations prior to their journey - this is an opportunity to purchase gear from Halfyord, or potentially seek out some of the other caravan merchants.
Other members of the caravan will largely recount the came events, though the wealthier ones will also be able to comment on how Baron-Sir Caius' race-course is rather popular among the nobility.
Kamonas - if the party seeks her out - will also be able to comment on this.

If the party is in good standing with the Ordo Magicae, they may visit to purchase supplies and items too - the Ordo's stock will not have replenished to its normal levels just yet, but they will have basic healing potions and a few scrolls available for purchase.
In particular, the Ordo will have some scrolls of Speak with Animals available for purchase, at a slightly discounted rate.

## Next Scenes

After this scene, the party proceeds to [02 - On the Road Again](./02-on-the-road-again.md).
