title: On the Road Again
---

The party sets off for Trawidok, stopping at the campsite where the caravan was ambushed along the way.

This scene serves to do the following things:

- Introduces Rolf Timberfell and his band to the party, potentially ingratiating them to the party.
- Sets the seeds of the first clues as to the nature of the horse-thefts in Trawidok.

At the end of the scene, the party should hopefully:

- Reach Trawidok.
- Met Rolf's band in the forest.
- Had a chance to investigate the campsite where the ambush took place.

The party can also obtain the following information:

- They may notice the odd combination of hoof-prints leading away from the camp.
- Rolf will also happily talk about his employer, if his band is helped in the clearing.

## Setting

This scene takes place on the road from Halfyord to Trawidok.

The road is wide and well-maintained for the first day's travel or so.
Proximity to Halfyord likely means that the city maintains this portion of the road to keep up good appearances, and the party will see relatively frequent outrider patrols for the first 10 miles or so after leaving Halfyord.
As the distance to Halfyord increases, the road gradually gets narrower - though never too narrow for two carts to pass each other - and transitions from cobblestones to gravel to dirt.

To the east of the road are the steep banks of the River Hal.
After just over a day's travel, the road crosses the Halbrook and splits at a junction, the main road continuing along the River Hal whilst a signed, one-wagon-wide dirt road follows the Halbrook for a couple of miles, before running across the farming plains of Trawidok and reaching the village after another day or so's travel.

All the while the road is made of dirt, and prior to crossing the Halbrook, the road travels through a dense woodland / forest.
Paige will have told the party that the campsite the caravan used can be identified when they see a large tree growing around a boulder on the river-side of the road.
Opposite this boulder is a one-wagon-wide path that leads to the clearing where the caravan made camp.

The woods are not tame and wolves, bears, and other denizens roam the deeper parts, however so do many game animals including elk and wild horses.
Though the roads are usually safe from anything worse than bears, evidence of the presence of such creatures can be heard whilst travelling.

## Random Encounters

If you are playing an adventure or campaign that involves random encounters, you may want to roll on an appropriate table for an encounter as the party travels.

Keep in mind however, that the party will likely get into a scrap when they reach the campsite and potentially rest for the evening.

## Journey to the Campsite

When the party sets off, ask if one person is navigating or if the party is taking collective responsibility for their journey.
All party members involved should roll a Survival check to determine the party's travel progress; taking the average of all group members that are attempting to help.

- (Survival, DC 0) Progress is slow and hampered by unforeseen obstacles, like a herd of elk running across the path or recent rainfall / water falling from the forest canopy making the road difficult to traverse. The party will reach the boulder around dusk, when they'll start to need light to not be disadvantaged on their investigative rolls
  - 10+: Progress is good, and the party reaches the boulder at the equivalent of 16:00 (if they set off at first light), just before the light is beginning to fade.

The party's travel is another good opportunity for role-playing conversations, or for the party to get to know each other if they do not already.
Once the party reaches the boulder, draw this to their attention.
Also comment on for how much longer it will remain light, and thus how feasible more travel for the day is.
The party should hopefully choose to make for the clearing and the campsite, though they may attempt to find a better spot to camp and investigate the campsite in the morning (or not at all, see below).

## The Campsite

If the party attempts to camp elsewhere for the night, and in the morning begins to leave without visiting the campsite, have them hear the [combat encounter](#combat-encounter) start between Rolf's band and the animals they have inadvertently attracted.
If they still choose not to investigate, simply have Rolf and his band show up (battered and bruised, but alive) to the race-course after the party visits the Baron-Sir, where the party can overhear their report.

Otherwise, if the party heads along the narrow path opposite the boulder towards the clearing to make camp, have the party make a perception check as they approach the clearing.

- (Perception DC 10) There are lights in the clearing, as it comes into view.
  - 12+: The light appears to be coming from torches, that have been placed in a circular-like configuration around some tents.
  - 15+: Sounds of conversation can be heard as the party approaches. Wood can be heard being chopped.

The clearing is roughly ovular in shape, with the major-axis of the oval running west-east and the narrow path entering the clearing on the east side, just below the "apex" of the oval.
The dirt path gives way to a grassy field that is strewn with harmless flora.
Close to where the path joins the clearing, [Rolf Timberfell](../characters/rolf-timberfell.md) and his band will have set up camp.
They have pitched tents around a central campfire, and one member of the band can be seen placing rocks and sticks in order to start a fire.
Torches have been fastened to poles around the campsite, leaving a reasonable distance between where the torches are and the rather flammable tents.
Depending on how dark it is, these might already be lit.

At the far end of the clearing, the majority of Rolf's band will be setting up their lure.
They have tied up various chunks of meat and other predator-attracting foods, as set up a few snare traps on the floor nearby.
Rolf and his band are not actively carrying their weapons - most of these are resting beside knapsacks or tents.
They are also not hostile towards the party (assuming the party is not hostile towards them), and will be quite friendly in their greetings to the party if they catch sight of them.
A few of the members near the lure will have hunting knives on them, and the member near the fire might be carrying a woodcutter's axe.
If the party chooses to sneak up towards the campsite, fearing bandits, have them make a Stealth check against the member of the band tending to the fire.

- (Stealth DC 15) (ADV: It is dark and the character is not using a light source) To not be noticed by the band member as the character approaches the campsite.
  - If failed, the band member at the campsite will call out with a hint of suspicion in their voice to the approaching party members. They will explicitly say that Rolf's band "don't want any trouble".

If the party simply approaches without taking any measures to hide themselves, the band member at the campfire will greet them when they approach.
This will get Rolf's attention, who will come over to greet the party.
He will introduce his band, and if asked will explain that they are here to track down the horses that went missing a few days ago.

### Rolf's Plan

If the party mentions they are travelling to Trawidok because of the bounty letter, or because they heard of the attack that Rolf mentioned, he will be a bit more forthcoming with information.
He will happily recount what happened that night, mentioning that he and two other members of his troop were the guards sent by the Baron-Sir.

Rolf will then explain that his plan is to camp here for the evening, with the band taking shifts watching the lures at the far end of the clearing.
He hopes that this will attract the predators that ambushed them before, which will enable his party to kill the beasts and track them back to their den, where he presumes he will find the remains of the two horses that panicked.
Rolf will invite the party to set up their tents / bedding within the circle of torches his band have already setup, and mention that the member of his band near the campfire should have started on some stew by now.

The party can continue to ask Rolf questions, both about the attack a few nights ago or his plan.
They might also choose to look around the area for further clues (or ask if Rolf has done so already), or help the rest of Rolf's band set up the snares or lure at the far end of the clearing.

- Rolf will mention that most of the tracks made two nights ago have been claimed by the rain the previous day, but he will direct the party to where the two horse-shoe trails start in the clearing.
  - (Survival / Nature DC 12) The horse-shoe prints can be picked out of the mud, but are quite faded. The general direction of the prints seems to be towards the northern edge of the clearing.
    - 13+: The trail leads into the woods, where it continues for about 500 metres before being lost to the undergrowth and churn of the ground. The only notable direction is that it seems to head towards the Halbrook.
    - 14+: A number of tree branches and small shrubs along this track look like they have been trampled or broken by fast moving creatures.
    - 15+: Even though the tracks are faded, the distance between the horse-shoe prints looks to be too small to resemble two horses fleeing at roughly the same time. The stride distance between pairs of prints is too small, as if more horses were fleeing behind the two that were reported to escape.
    - 18+: One set of these horse-shoe prints faces the wrong way, as if approaching the clearing. These prints stop before the clearing itself.
    - 20+: The reverse-direction prints form a U-turn at the clearing's edge, which is where the "additional" prints (see the 15+ information) come from. These prints also disappear a shorter distance into the woods than the other tracks.
    - 22+: Some of the tree branches that are broken are quite far up the trees themselves, likely at or above the upper end of what a horses' height would naturally be.
- Party members can also go across to help with the lure that Rolf's men are putting together. They can also ask about what animals they're expecting to lure, to which the men will respond with wolves (as per their experience at the ambush a few days ago).
  - (Survival DC 10 / Nature DC 13) Despite claiming they are planning to attract wolves, there are nuts, berries and other plant-based foods present in the lure, alongside meats. A character who spots this can raise this with the members of Rolf's band, who will accept their mistake and say they just asked someone in Trawidok for some hunting bait. They will hand over more of these pre-made lures for a character to take apart and recombine into something more sensible.
- Around the lure, Rolf's band have places some snare traps they plan to set during the night. The snares closest to the forest edge have already been set, but those between the camp and the lure are not yet.
  - (Survival DC 13 / Perception DC 13) No attempt has been made to conceal the lures in undergrowth or under the dirt. A character can raise this with the nearby members of Rolf's band and they will invite the character to use their initiative. Allow the character to arrange the supply of snares as they see fit before the evening is out (this will come into play tomorrow morning).

Once the party is done investigating, they can join Rolf's camp and rest for the evening.
They also have the opportunity to ask Rolf more questions if they want, and try to befriend him or some of the members of his group.
Before allowing the group to rest for the evening, be sure to:

- Mention that the torches around the campsite are light shortly after dark. The lure is just barely visible in the dim light at the far end of the clearing, but any hidden snares are almost impossible to see.
- Rolf will assign three shifts for a watch during the night, with himself taking the first shift. He will invite the party to partner up with one of his men for each shift during the night, but will not demand it if no-one in the party wants to do so.

If any party members take a shift, have them roll a perception check (along with the member of Rolf's band they are with) to determine what catches their eye in the evening.
If a later shift rolls in the same bracket as an earlier shift, provide the information of the previous bracket (working down the brackets if necessary).

- (Perception DC 5) There is some faint howling sounds, but nothing that is close.
  - 10+: Rustling sounds can be heard coming from the treeline, though you don't see anything emerge.
  - 13+: You can catch a glance at some of the shapes in the forest, where the torchlight is just carrying to. It looks like a large animal, like an elk or deer, was headed toward the clearing before something scared it off.
  - 16+: A flicker of light from one of the torches catches on something in the woods - what looks to be a pair of eyes and a muzzle. You see a dog-sized creature quickly turn about and scamper back into the woods.

### The Morning

In the morning the campsite will awaken to a foggy scene, hindering (but not necessarily limiting) visibility.
Once most of the campsite is awake, a couple of Rolf's men will grab a torch each from the rear of the camp (the further points away from the lure and snares), and walk out of camp to inspect the snares.
A party member can join them if they so wish.
Other members of Rolf's band will start striking the camp and preparing breakfast, which includes putting the torches out, but not packing away the stands they sit on.

Rolf will greet the party and begin explaining the band's plans for the day, if he was not asked about it last night.
He and his band plan to follow any tracks deeper into the woods, to find any clues as to the missing horse's whereabouts or the animal den they presume is responsible for the attack a few days ago.
Rolf will suggest the party continue on to Trawidok, since he doesn't have enough supplies to accommodate the party, and also because they're working a bounty and so won't be sharing the reward!
Have this conversation be interrupted by the events that start combat below.

If any party members went to check the snares and lure, they will find that it is untouched, and none of the snares have closed.
Party members (but not Rolf's band) at the lures / snares can make the following check at this point:

- (Perception DC 14) The unmistakable sound of leaves rustling and paw-prints approaching can be heard in the undergrowth. Give these characters an action to prepare themselves, before starting combat as below.

## Combat Encounter

Out of the undergrowth at the end of the clearing, and through the fog, a pack of wolves bursts out, encircling the group that has gone to check the lures.
Wolves that pass near a snare need to make the appropriate Perception check to avoid triggering the trap.
The wolves form a loose perimeter around the group at the lure, approximately 30ft away from any one group member.
The portion of the pack between the camp and the lures has half its members focused on the lure party and the other half keeping watch on the camp.

Roll initiative for all present characters.

- Wolves to the front, bears to the rear.
- The party can use the torches to dissuade the wild animals.

### Encounter Information

Trigger: The morning comes
Intended difficulty: Hard / Deadly

Participants based on party size:

| Party size | Wolves (at any 1 time) | Bears | Other adjustments |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|-|
| 3- | 10 | 2 | Rolf's band consists of 4 men, including himself. |
| 4  | 10 | 2 | Rolf's band consists of 4 men, including himself. |
| 5  | 10 | 3 | Rolf's band consists of 5 men, including himself. |
| 6+ | 10 | 3 | Rolf's band consists of 5 men, including himself. |

**Enemy Objectives:**

- The wolves and bears have come seeking a meal, attracted by both the lure and the food kept in the campsite. They also won't turn their noses up at any easy targets.
  - The wolves are primarily interested in the lure and any people who happen to be unfortunate enough to be nearby.
  - The bears will wander into the campsite looking for food.
- Rolf's men will attempt to re-group in the camp, using the torchlight to keep the animals at bay until they disperse. They will attempt to rescue their friends in trouble too.

**Combat ends when:**

The party and Rolf's band successfully secure the campsite, and no characters are stranded or in peril from the wolves.
The campsite can be secured by re-forming the torch-line that was present during the night, or improvising this with hand-held torches to form a safe perimeter.

When this happens, proceed to [aftermath of the attack](#aftermath-of-the-attack), below.

### Initial Locations

The wolf pack starts in a loose circular formation around the group of characters inspecting the lure.
The group at the lure consists of two of Rolf's men and potentially some party members.
All remaining characters are placed in appropriate locations in the camp.

The bears in the woods do not start on the map, and join after the first round of combat at their initiative count.

### Other Encounter Factors

- Bear arrival: after one combat round, the bears enter the clearing from the treeline closest to where Rolf's men removed torches to go and look at the snares.
- Fog: the fog is starting to fade, but still affects visibility at medium to long ranges.
  - Ranged attacks have their short range halved for the purposes of this encounter.
  - Ranged spell attacks are also at disadvantage if launched at a target further than half their usual range away.
  - Spells that line of sight aimed at targets more than half their range away require the caster to make a Perception check with DC 13. On a fail, the spell targets a random creature within the caster's field of view (roll a suitable dice to determine the target, which includes the intended target). On a success, the spell works as normal.
- Snares: characters and creatures must take care to avoid the snares laid out the night before. See the [item entry](../items/snare-trap.md) for details.
- Fire and torches:
  - The wolves are frightened of all creatures they can see carrying a lit torch (or other source of fire) within 10ft of them. They will not approach within 10ft of such a source of fire (that they can see), and must not be within 10ft of such a source by the end of their turn, if they can avoid it. They may still attack a creature if they start their turn in the radius, before retreating to a safe distance.
  - The bears will not willingly approach within 5ft of a source of fire.
  - Whenever a bear or wolf is attacked by a creature carrying a torch or other source of flame, or an effect or weapon that uses fire, it must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 13) or immediately move 5ft away from the source of the attack. This movement can provoke opportunity attacks.
  - Creatures wielding a source of fire can replace an of attack on their turn to wave and move the flame source in a manner that scares all wolves and bears within 10ft of the fire source. The affected creatures must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 13) or immediately move 5ft away from the creature performing this action. If a creature has multiple attacks on its turn, it can continue to replace attacks with this effect.
- The pack is tireless: wolves that drop to below half their hit points retreat to the treeline on their turn, and are removed from the encounter. The next turn, a number of wolves equal to those that fled in this manner enter the combat from the treeline within 30ft of another wolf. Wolves that are outright killed are also replaced in this manner.

### Loot

- Pelts from any killed animals.

### Notes

- The party and Rolf's band are not meant to kill all hostile creatures in this fight, hence the swarming wolves.
- Give audible clues concerning the fact that fire can be used against the creatures. For example, have Rolf or another member in the camp grab a torch before moving out of the camp, and describe the wolves reacting accordingly. Alternatively, have one of Rolf's band members near the lures wave his torch in panic on his turn.
- The wolves and bears are not allies, but are also not exactly friends. They may engage in stand-offs with each other if the situation arises. However, the bears will tend to investigate the campsite for food, whilst the wolves' concern is the lure and immediate group of people.

## Aftermath of the Attack

Once the campsite is secure, the wolves and bears will begin dispersing into the forest, taking any prizes they've been able to claim with them.
The wolves will stick around to drag the lure and any unfortunate victims with them into the woods, whilst the bears will retreat towards the Halbrook or river Hal once driven out of the camp.

The survivors of Rolf's band will be taking deep breaths, and once the animals disperse will begin to assess the damage.
Rolf will make an offhand sarcastic comment about the "best laid plans", before engaging the party in conversation.
His plans have changed since before the combat encounter, and he will suggest the party and his group travel back to Trawidok together.

- If any members of his band suffered serious injuries (or were killed) during the fight, Rolf will use this as a reason for needing to head back to Trawidok.
- Otherwise, the lure and a number of supplies in the camp will have been lost to the animals. Rolf will chastise the member of his band who left the food stores on ground level in the camp - which attracted the bears. He will then deem his earlier plans too dangerous without proper supplies, so suggest travelling back to Trawidok.

The party can try to look around the area for clues, however there is nothing of particular note to be found that was not available the previous evening.
If the party decides to pursue the animals into the woods themselves, drop (increasingly obvious) hints that this is not a good idea.
If they persist and head into the forest, Rolf and his men will not follow them, though Rolf will tell them to report any success they find to the Baron-Sir when they eventually make it to Trawidok.
They can follow the wolf tracks back to the wolves' den a few miles to the north-west of the clearing, where the pack awaits.
There is no meaningful loot in the den, but the party can then report to the people of Trawidok that they dealt with the vicious wolves.

## Next Scenes

The party should proceed to [03 - Arrival at Trawidok](./03-arrival-in-trawidok.md).
