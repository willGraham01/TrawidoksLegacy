title: On the Road Again
---

The party sets off for Trawidok, stopping at the campsite where the caravan was ambushed along the way.

This scene serves to do the following things:

- Introduces Rolf Timberfell and his band to the party, potentially ingratiating them to the party.
- Sets the seeds of the first clues as to the nature of the horse-thefts in Trawidok.

At the end of the scene, the party should hopefully:

- Reach Trawidok.
- Met Rolf's band in the forest.
- Had a chance to investigate the campsite where the ambush took place.

The party can also obtain the following information:

- They may notice the odd combination of hoof-prints leading away from the camp.
- Rolf will also happily talk about his employer, if his band is helped in the clearing.

## Setting

This scene takes place on the road from Halfyord to Trawidok.

The road is wide and well-maintained for the first day's travel or so.
Proximity to Halfyord likely means that the city maintains this portion of the road to keep up good appearances, and the party will see relatively frequent outrider patrols for the first 10 miles or so after leaving Halfyord.
As the distance to Halfyord increases, the road gradually gets narrower - though never too narrow for two carts to pass each other - and transitions from cobblestones to gravel to dirt.

To the east of the road are the steep banks of the River Hal.
After just over a day's travel, the road crosses the Halbrook and splits at a junction, the main road continuing along the River Hal whilst a signed, one-wagon-wide dirt road follows the Halbrook for a couple of miles, before running across the farming plains of Trawidok and reaching the village after another day or so's travel.

All the while the road is made of dirt, and prior to crossing the Halbrook, the road travels through a dense woodland / forest.
Paige will have told the party that the campsite the caravan used can be identified when they see a large tree growing around a boulder on the river-side of the road.
Opposite this boulder is a one-wagon-wide path that leads to the clearing where the caravan made camp.

The woods are not tame and wolves, bears, and other denizens roam the deeper parts, however so do many game animals including elk and wild horses.
Though the roads are usually safe from anything worse than bears, evidence of the presence of such creatures can be heard whilst travelling.

## Random Encounters

If you are playing an adventure or campaign that involves random encounters, you may want to roll on an appropriate table for an encounter as the party travels.

Keep in mind however, that the party will likely get into a scrap when they reach the campsite and potentially rest for the evening.

## Journey to the Campsite

When the party sets off, ask if one person is navigating or if the party is taking collective responsibility for their journey.
All party members involved should roll a Survival check to determine the party's travel progress; taking the average of all group members that are attempting to help.

- (Survival, DC 0) Progress is slow and hampered by unforeseen obstacles, like a herd of elk running across the path or recent rainfall / water falling from the forest canopy making the road difficult to traverse. The party will reach the boulder around dusk, when they'll start to need light to not be disadvantaged on their investigative rolls
  - 10+: Progress is good, and the party reaches the boulder at the equivalent of 16:00 (if they set off at first light), just before the light is beginning to fade.

The party's travel is another good opportunity for role-playing conversations, or for the party to get to know each other if they do not already.
Once the party reaches the boulder, draw this to their attention.
Also comment on for how much longer it will remain light, and thus how feasible more travel for the day is.
The party should hopefully choose to make for the clearing and the campsite, though they may attempt to find a better spot to camp and investigate the campsite in the morning (or not at all, see below).

## The Campsite

If the party attempts to camp elsewhere for the night, and in the morning begins to leave without visiting the campsite, have them hear the [combat encounter]() start between Rolf's band and the animals they have inadvertently attracted.
If they still choose not to investigate, simply have Rolf and his band show up (battered and bruised, but alive) to the race-course after the party visits the Baron-Sir, where the party can overhear their report.

Otherwise, if the party heads along the narrow path opposite the boulder towards the clearing to make camp, have the party make a perception check as they approach the clearing.

- (Perception DC 10) There are lights in the clearing, as it comes into view.
  - 12+: The light appears to be coming from torches, that have been placed in a circular-like configuration around some tents.
  - 15+: Sounds of conversation can be heard as the party approaches. Wood can be heard being chopped.

The clearing is roughly ovular in shape, with the major-axis of the oval running west-east and the narrow path entering the clearing on the east side, just below the "apex" of the oval.
The dirt path gives way to a grassy field that is strewn with harmless flora.
Close to where the path joins the clearing, [Rolf Timberfell](../characters/rolf-timberfell.md) and his band will have set up camp.
They have pitched tents around a central campfire, and one member of the band can be seen placing rocks and sticks in order to start a fire.
Torches have been fastened to poles around the campsite, leaving a reasonable distance between where the torches are and the rather flammable tents.
Depending on how dark it is, these might already be lit.

At the far end of the clearing, the majority of Rolf's band will be setting up their lure.
They have tied up various chunks of meat and other predator-attracting foods, as set up a few snare traps on the floor nearby.
Rolf and his band are not actively carrying their weapons - most of these are resting beside knapsacks or tents.
They are also not hostile towards the party (assuming the party is not hostile towards them), and will be quite friendly in their greetings to the party if they catch sight of them.
A few of the members near the lure will have hunting knives on them, and the member near the fire might be carrying a woodcutter's axe.
If the party chooses to sneak up towards the campsite, fearing bandits, have them make a Stealth check against the member of the band tending to the fire.

- (Stealth DC 15) (ADV: It is dark and the character is not using a light source) To not be noticed by the band member as the character approaches the campsite.
  - If failed, the band member at the campsite will call out with a hint of suspicion in their voice to the approaching party members. They will explicitly say that Rolf's band "don't want any trouble".

If the party simply approaches without taking any measures to hide themselves, the band member at the campfire will greet them when they approach.
This will get Rolf's attention, who will come over to greet the party.
He will introduce his band, and if asked will explain that they are here to track down the horses that went missing a few days ago.

### Rolf's Plan

If the party mentions they are travelling to Trawidok because of the bounty letter, or because they heard of the attack that Rolf mentioned, he will be a bit more forthcoming with information.
He will happily recount what happened that night, mentioning that he and two other members of his troop were the guards sent by the Baron-Sir.

Rolf will then explain that his plan is to camp here for the evening, with the band taking shifts watching the lures at the far end of the clearing.
He hopes that this will attract the predators that ambushed them before, which will enable his party to kill the beasts and track them back to their den, where he presumes he will find the remains of the two horses that panicked.
Rolf will invite the party to set up their tents / bedding within the circle of torches his band have already setup, and mention that the member of his band near the campfire should have started on some stew by now.

The party can continue to ask Rolf questions, both about the attack a few nights ago or his plan.
They might also choose to look around the area for further clues (or ask if Rolf has done so already), or help the rest of Rolf's band set up the snares or lure at the far end of the clearing.

- Rolf will mention that most of the tracks made two nights ago have been claimed by the rain the previous day, but he will direct the party to where the two horse-shoe trails start in the clearing.
  - (Survival / Nature DC 12) The horse-shoe prints can be picked out of the mud, but are quite faded. The general direction of the prints seems to be towards the northern edge of the clearing.
    - 13+: The trail leads into the woods, where it continues for about 500 metres before being lost to the undergrowth and churn of the ground. The only notable direction is that it seems to head towards the Halbrook.
    - 14+: A number of tree branches and small shrubs along this track look like they have been trampled or broken by fast moving creatures.
    - 15+: Even though the tracks are faded, the distance between the horse-shoe prints looks to be too small to resemble two horses fleeing at roughly the same time. The stride distance between pairs of prints is too small, as if more horses were fleeing behind the two that were reported to escape.
    - 18+: One set of these horse-shoe prints faces the wrong way, as if approaching the clearing. These prints stop before the clearing itself.
    - 20+: The reverse-direction prints form a U-turn at the clearing's edge, which is where the "additional" prints (see the 15+ information) come from. These prints also disappear a shorter distance into the woods than the other tracks.
    - 22+: Some of the tree branches that are broken are quite far up the trees themselves, likely at or above the upper end of what a horses' height would naturally be.
